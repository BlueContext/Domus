#### A Simple Recipe Website Built with Hugo

This is the source code and content for a simple website I use as a recipe file. The recipes are stored as markdown files (with some Hugo-specific front-matter) in a directory structure, and I use Hugo and the Book theme (with some customizations) to generate the site from the files and directory structure.

You can see the site [here](https://domus.kosmolabs.org).
