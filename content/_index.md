## I like to cook

I always have. Feeding myself and my loved ones has always seemed like more of a pleasure than a chore to me, and cooking has been a constant source of joy and interest for me.

## This is my site

This is just a place for me to stash my recipes. It has a secondary purpose of letting me tinker with static web sites and the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo"). My goal is for this is be and remain as simple and readable as a printed book.
