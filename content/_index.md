## I like to cook

I always have. Feeding myself and my loved ones has always seemed like more of a pleasure than a chore to me. Cooking has been a constant companion as well as a source of joy and and endless domain of inquiry.

## This is my site

This is just a place for me to stash my recipes and thoughts on cooking. It has a secondary purpose of letting me tinker with static web sites and the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo"). My goal is for this is be and remain simple, fast and easy to use -- as easy as a printed book.
