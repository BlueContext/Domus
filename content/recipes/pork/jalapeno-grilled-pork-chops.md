### Instructions
#### Prepare the pork chops
Add the jalapeños, garlic, cilantro stems, rice vinegar, olive oil, salt and sugar to the work bowl of a food processor, and process until smooth. Place the pork chops in a resealable freezer bag or a glass dish. Pour the green marinade over them, and turn to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes — overnight is better.

#### Prepare the relish
In a small bowl, toss the jalapeño, red onion, vinegar, salt, sugar, and 2 tbsp water. Set aside to quick-pickle until ready to serve, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

#### Cook and Serve
Prepare a charcoal grill for direct high-heat cooking. When it’s hot, carefully grease the grill grate using tongs and a wad of paper towel dipped in oil.

With the marinade clinging to them, place the pork chops on the hot greased grate. Grill until the chops are charred at the edges and no longer pink in the middle, 2-3 minutes per side. 

Pile the chops on a platter. Sprinkle the relish and cilantro leaves over the top and serve
