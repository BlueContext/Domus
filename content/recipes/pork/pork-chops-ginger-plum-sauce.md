### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

4 1”-thick pork chops 
1 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tbsp sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
2 tbsp packed brown sugar
1 star anise pod
1 scant tbsp finely grated fresh ginger
1 large clove garlic, finely minced
4 firm-but-ripe black plums (1 lb), pitted and cut into 1” wedges
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 tbsp red currant jelly
1 tbsp cold butter

</div>

### Instructions
Put a rack in the middle of the oven, heated to 300F.   

Pat the pork dry, season with salt and pepper. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until quite hot, 2-3 minutes. 

Add the oil, swirling to coat the pan. Add the pork and cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes. 

Transfer the chops to a small baking pan and bake until just cooked through, about 8-12 minutes. 

Meanwhile, return the skillet to medium heat and add the soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, star anise, ginger and garlic.  Bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up and brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Add the plums and cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until the plums are tender but not falling apart, and the sauce is slightly thickened, 5-10 minutes. 

Stir in the stock, jelly, and any meat juices from the chops and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and swirl in the pat of cold butter until the sauce is slightly thickened.  

Spoon the sauce over the chops.
