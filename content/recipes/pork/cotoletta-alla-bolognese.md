title: Cotoletta alla Bolognese (Breaded Pork Cutlets)
serves: "Serves 4"
summary: "Fairly easy and quick, this simple recipe produces a surprisingly elegant dinner. This is traditionally made with veal, which is wonderful but pricey. Pork makes a reasonable substitute, but if you're feeling celebratory, get yourself some veal scallops -- you can skip the pounding in that case."

### Instructions

Put the panko crumbs into a food processor and pulse until they are reduced to a finer texture. Empty them into a pie plate or large shallow bowl, and stir in 1/2 tsp black pepper.  In a second similar dish, stir the flour with 1 tsp black pepper.  In a third dish, beat the eggs with a fork.

Cut the pork tenderloin in half crosswise, making the tail end slightly larger.  Cut each of the two pieces in half lengthwise.

Place a piece between two sheets of plastic wrap and use a meat mallet to gently pound out to an even 1/8" thickness. Repeat with the remaining pieces of pork. Season both sides of each cutlet with pepper, then lay a prosciutto slice on each cutlet. Re-cover with the plastic wrap and pound very gently to adhere the prosciutto. 

One at a time, dredge the cutlets in flour to coat, shaking off excess, then dip in the egg, and finally coat with the crumbs, pressing them onto the meat. Set the prepared cutlets on a large plate. Refrigerate uncovered for 15 minutes to let the coating set.

Set a wire rack over a baking sheet lined with paper towels and place near the stove. 

Place a 12-inch skillet over medium heat and add 6 tbsp of the oil. Heat until just barely smoking. Add two of the cutlets and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Use tongs to flip the cutlets and cook until the second side is golden. Transfer to the prepared rack. Repeat with the remaining 6 tbsp oil and 2 cutlets.  Wipe out the skillet and set aside.

Evenly sprinkle the cutlets with the grated parmesan cheese. Place two cutlets (cheese side up) back in the pan and place over medium heat. Pour 1 tbsp water around the cutlets and immediately cover the pan and cook until the cheese is melted, the water fully evaporated, and the cutlets begin to sizzle, 1-2 minutes. Using a large spatula, return the cutlets to the rack and repeat this procedure with the other two cutlets. Tent them with foil.  Wipe out the skillet.

In the same skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and add the garlic. Cook gently, stirring, until fragrant but not browned (less than a minute). Add the broth and cook over medium-high until reduced to 1/3 cup (about 3 minutes). Remove from heat, stir in the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce into a serving bowl.

Transfer the cutlets to a platter. Sprinkle with minced parsley, surround with lemon wedges and serve with the sauce.
