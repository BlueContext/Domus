### Instructions

Add the julienned carrots and daikon (if using) to a large bowl and toss with sugar, salt, vinegar and sesame oil. Set aside and stir occasionally.

Combine all the meatball ingredients in a bowl and form into meatballs (not too large -- you should get about 20). 

Place the meatballs on a wax paper-lined baking sheet and transfer to the freezer for 15 minutes. After the meatballs have chilled, heat a tbsp of oil in a cast iron or nonstick skillet over high heat. Fry the meatballs until they are browned on all sides and cooked through.

In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise and sriracha. Open up each roll or section of baguette, and spread the sriracha mayonnaise on each side of the interior. Fill with the pickled carrots, cooked meatballs, sliced jalapeno, sliced cucumbers,and cilantro leaves to taste. Serve immediately.
