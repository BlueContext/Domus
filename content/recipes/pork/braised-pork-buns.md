You'll need an Instant Pot for this.

Dark soy sauce is an ingredient worth seeking out to have on hand. Much darker and less salty than light (“regular”) soy sauce, it is used to add a distinctively dark and rich color to dishes like this one, where the braising liquid is reduced to a sticky glaze.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 tbsp peanut oil  
1 1/2 tbsp sugar  
1 1/2 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 2” pieces  
1/2 tsp Five spice powder  
1/4 cup Shaoxing wine, dry sherry, or dry sake   
1/4 cup light soy sauce  
1 tbsp dark soy sauce  
1/2 cup water  
6-8 bao (you can get them frozen, or make your own Lotus Leaf Buns)
Fresh garnishes for serving — I like to pick at least two from the following: sliced cucumbers, sliced scallions, thinly sliced chili peppers, fresh cilantro leaves, fresh mint leaves

### Instructions
Heat the Instant Pot on the sauté setting. Add the oil and sugar to the pot. Melt the sugar until you get a paste. Add the pork and cook until lightly browned.

Add the five spice, wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water. Stir to combine and close the Instant Pot. Set the vent the not venting.  Set the Instant Pot to the meat/stew setting on high pressure for 30 minutes.

Steam the frozen bao while the pork cooks.

When the cooking time has elapsed, release the pressure either by quick release or natural release. Open the Instant Pot and turn on the sauté setting to reduce the braising liquid. Let the sauce simmer until it’s thick and sticky and coats the pork.

Serve the pork in a bowl alongside the bao and fresh garnishes. To eat, grab a steamed bun and fill it with pork and sauce. Top with fresh garnishes. Fold over and enjoy!
