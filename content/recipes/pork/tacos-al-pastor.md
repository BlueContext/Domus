### Instructions
Cut six ½” thick rounds from the pineapple. Quarter 2 of the slices and add to a food processor or blender. Add the oil, garlic, chilies, cumin, ancho powder, brown sugar and 4 teaspoons salt. Process or blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Reserve ½ cup of the puree and set aside. 

Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with foil. Using a chef's knife, slice the tenderloin in half lengthwise, stopping about ½ inch shy of cutting all the way through. Open up the tenderloin like a book and place it between 2 large sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat pounder, gently pound the pork to an even ½-inch thickness. Transfer to 1 of the prepared baking sheets and season both sides with salt and pepper. Spread half of the reserved pineapple puree on top, flip the pork and spread with the remaining reserved puree. Let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pour the remaining puree into a small bowl, stir in 1 tablespoon of the lime juice and set aside for serving. 

Meanwhile, heat the broiler to high with a rack 4 inches from the element. Lightly coat the second prepared baking sheet with oil. Arrange 4 of the remaining pineapple slices and the onion slices in a single layer on the baking sheet and broil until charred in spots, 7 to 10 minutes; the onion should retain some crunch. Transfer the pineapple and onion to a cutting board and set aside. 

Broil the tenderloin until charred in spots and the center reaches 140°F or is just barely pink when cut, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut the pork lengthwise into 2-inch-wide strips, then cut crosswise into thin slices. Transfer to a medium bowl and pour in any accumulated juices. Add 3 tablespoons of the pineapple puree and stir to combine. Tent with foil. 

Chop the broiled onion and pineapple into ½-inch pieces. Add to a small bowl along with the cilantro and remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice. Toss, then taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve the pork, the onion-pineapple salsa and the remaining reserved pineapple puree with tortillas and lime wedges.
