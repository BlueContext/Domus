<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 tbsp uncooked Japanese rice  
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil  
* 1 lb ground pork or dark chicken meat  
* 1/4 tsp sugar  
* 1 tbsp fish sauce  
* Juice of 1 large or 2 small limes  
* 1 red chili or Serrano, sliced

### Instructions
In a small dry pan over low heat, toast the rice grains, stirring continuously, until they are golden and fragrant (about 10 minutes). Let them cool a bit and grind them to a coarse powder in a mortar and pestle. Set aside.

Mix the sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, and Sambal Olek (to taste) in  a small bowl.

Place a cast iron skillet or wok over high heat. When hot, add the oil. When the oil is starting to smoke, add the pork and stir-fry until it is brown. Add in the toasted rice powder and the fish sauce-lime juice mixture. Stir fry for 1 minute.

Add the chili, shallots, scallions, cilantro and mint. Stir-fry for another minute or two (the shallots just just slightly soften), and then taste for seasoning (add more chili, sugar, fish sauce or lime juice as desired).
