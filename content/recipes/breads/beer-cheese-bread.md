I’m sure you’ll see the many ways you could vary this recipe: sharp cheddar or pepper jack in place of the Gruyère; parsley, mixed herbs, or scallions in place of chives; judicious additions of red pepper flakes or a bit of garlic powder, etc. But when it comes to the beer, stay away from IPAs or ales — what you want here to a light crisp lager, something you’d drink after mowing the lawn on a summer day.

### Ingredients
<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1/2 cup minced chives
* 1 1/2 cups shredded Gruyère, plus an additional 1/3 cup to scatter on top
* 3 tbsp melted butter
* 1 1/4 cup plain lager beer
* Oil to grease the pan.

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 450°F. Grease a 10” cast iron skillet with oil and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the Flour, salt, pepper, cayenne, baking powder, and sugar. Whisk to combine.  Add the chives and the shredded cheese, and toss with your hands to combine everything thoroughly — this will help the cheese remain distributed throughout the dough while baking. 

Add the melted butter and the beer, and stir until fully combined.

Turn the dough into the pan and spread it evenly to the edges with a spatula (it won’t spread much on its own in the oven). Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup of cheese evenly over the top of the bread. Bake for 20-25 minutes; the top should be golden brown, and a pick inserted in the center should come out clean.

Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Place a wire rack over the top of the pan and carefully invert the whole thing to turn the bread out of the pan (so that the bottom crust doesn’t get steamed). Place a second wire rack over the turned out loaf and invert again so it can cool, right-side up, for another 20 minutes.
