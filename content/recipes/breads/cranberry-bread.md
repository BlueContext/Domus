I cut up the cranberries in my food processor, pulsing and watching carefully — you don’t want them finely chopped!
### Ingredients
<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 cups flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* A pinch of freshly ground nutmeg
* 3/4 cup orange juice
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp grated orange zest
* 1 egg, well beaten
* 1 1/2 cup fresh cranberries, coarsely chopped
* 1/2 cup chopped and toasted nuts (pecans or walnuts are best)

### Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 9” x 5” loaf pan thoroughly.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda and nutmeg. Mix well.

Add the orange juice, oil, orange peel, and egg. Mix until well-blended. Stir in the cranberries and nuts. 

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading to level it. Bake for 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Cool on a rack for at least 15 minutes. Remove the bread from the pan and leave it to cool completely. It’s hard to wait, but if the bread is hot it will just fall apart when sliced.
