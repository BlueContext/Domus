### Ingredients
This dough also freezes beautifully. I quadruple the recipe below, and then divide the dough into quarters, oil the dough lightly, and freeze the dough balls in small freezer bag for up to 2 weeks. To use, pull a bag from the freezer in the morning and leave it on the counter; by late afternoon the dough is ready to bake.

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 3/4 cup lukewarm water
* 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 2 cups flour (bread flour, or King Arthur all-purpose) 
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt

</div>

### Instructions
Dissolve the yeast in the water in the bowl of a stand mixer (about 5 min).

Add the flour and salt.  Mix on lowest speed with the dough hook until a shaggy dough forms. Knead the dough for 5-8 minutes, either continuing with the dough hook attachment on the mixer, or by hand. The dough should be smooth, slightly tacky, and springy when poked.

Let the dough rise, covered, in a large bowl for 30 min to an hour at room temperature.  You can either continue at room temperature for a total rise of 1 1/2 hours (if you're making pizza the same day) or refridgerate the dough for up to 2 days. This allows for slow, cold fermentation that yields (to my taste) a superior flavor and texture.  

After this, the dough can be portioned and used or frozen.
