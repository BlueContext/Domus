### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 1/2 tbsp yeast
* 1 1/2 tbsp kosher salt
* 3 cups lukewarm water (about 100 degrees)
* 6 1/2 cups King Arthur all-purpose flour
* 2 tbsp stone-ground rye flour (optional)
* Cornmeal or semolina for sprinkling

</div>

### Instructions
In a large bowl or plastic container, mix the salt and yeast with the lukewarm water.  Stir in both flours, mixing until there are no dry patches. Cover (but not with an airtight lid) and let rise at room temperature for at least 2 and up to 5 hours.

At this point, either bake the bread or refrigerate the dough.

When ready to bake, take a large square of parchment paper, crumple it tightly, and flatten it back out. Dust the parchment with semolina.

Sprinkle a little flour over the dough and cut off a grapefruit-sized piece with a serrated knife. Using just enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands and work surface, gently and quickly shape the dough into a ball and place it seam-side-down on the parchment.  Sprinkle with semolina and cover loosely with another kitchen towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough or refrigerate it.

Let the loaf rise for about 40 minutes. When it is ready, it will not readily spring back when you poke it with a finger.

While the loaf is rising, place a 6-8 qt heavy oven-safe pot (such as a Dutch oven or enameled iron pot) into the oven empty (with lid) and preheat the oven to 450.  When the dough is ready, carefully remove the (extremely hot!) pot from the oven.  Lift the dough by the four corners of the parchment and place it in the Dutch oven.  Return the (very hot!) cover to the pot and bake for 20 minutes.   After 20 minutes, remove the lid and continue to bake until the loaf is very brown, sounds hollow when thumped, and is at least 190 F internally (10-20 minutes more).

Remove from the oven.  The loaf should release easily from the pot -- transfer it carefully to a rack to cool.
