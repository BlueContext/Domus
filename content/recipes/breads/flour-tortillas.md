serves: "Makes 8 large or 11 small"
summary: "My mom got this recipe from someone here in town a long time ago, and I found it handwritten in her Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook. I honestly don’t make tortillas very often — living in San Antonio, I can easily buy tortillas that are far better than anything I could make — but these are very tasty. Practice makes perfect! "

### Ingredients
<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 c. Flour
* 1 tsp. Salt
* 1/4 c. Lard 
* 1/2 c. Water (lukewarm)

</div>

### Instructions
Mix flour and salt in a bowl. With a pastry cutter, cut in the lard until the mixture resembles sand. Sprinkle in the water and mix to form a stiff dough. Form into a ball and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes.

Knead the dough until flecked with air bubbles. Divide into 8 balls for larger tortillas, or 11 balls for smaller ones. Press or roll out until thin.

Bake on a medium-hot griddle or comal for 20-30 seconds on each side, or until each side is dotted with brown spots.
