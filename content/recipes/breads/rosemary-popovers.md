title: Rosemary Popovers
serves: "Makes 8"
summary: "These are easy, beautiful, and an unusual side dish that will be most welcome alongside anything with a delicious gravy or sauce to mop up. A heavy popover pan will produce the very traditional shape, but a nonstick muffin tin will absolutely work just as well."

### Ingredients
<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 1/3 cups flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4 large eggs
* 1 1/3 cup milk
* 5 tbsp melted butter (or drippings from a rib roast)
* 1 heaping tbsp minced fresh rosemary leaves

</div>

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 350F *with the popover pan in it*.

In a blender, blend the flour, salt, eggs, milk and 4 tbsp of the butter, scraping down the sides, for 30 seconds.

Remove the hot pan from the oven and brush each cup with some of the remaining butter. Fill each cup half-full with batter and top each popover with  1/2 tsp rosemary.

Return to the oven and bake for 45 minutes without disturbing the oven, until theyâ€™re golden brown and crisp. Serve immediately.
