title: Blueberry Biscuits
serves: "Makes 8"
summary: "These are a “copycat” version of the “Bo-berry biscuits” sold by the fried chicken chain Bojangles (found throughout the American southeast). They look like they’d be incredibly sweet, but they’re salty and buttery like a good biscuit should be, with a faint sweetness, juicy blueberries, deliciously crispy edges, and a tart, sugary glaze."

Please note: you must use self-rising flour for this recipe — it contains leavening, and all-purpose flour will not work correctly.

### Ingredients
<div class="ingredient-list">

* 3 tbsp butter, melted and cooled
* 3 cups self-rising flour
* 3/8 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 1/2 sticks (6 oz) butter, frozen and grated on a box grater (keep cold)
* 1 1/2 cup frozen blue berries
* 1 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 1 cup confectioners sugar
* 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)

</div>

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 475F. Brush a cast iron skillet with some of the melted butter.

Make the glaze by mixing the confectioner’s sugar and the lemon juice in a small bowl. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Toss the grated butter in the flour mixture to coat and distribute. Toss the blueberries in the mixture to coat and distribute. Gently stir in the buttermilk with a wooden spoon just until a dough is formed.

Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Flour the top.  Pat or roll the dough out to a rough rectangle about 3/4 inch thick.  Using a bench scraper or spatula, fold the dough in half so that the short ends meet, then rotate, pat or roll back out, and repeat 2 more times.

With a floured 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out biscuits and place in the cast iron skillet, snug against one another. Bake until the tops are golden, about 18 minutes.  Brush the tops with the remaining melted butter and let cool for at least 5 minutes.  Drizzle with the glaze while still warm.
