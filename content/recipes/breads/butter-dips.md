### Ingredients
<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 1/4 cups flour
* 2 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 2/3 cup milk

</div>

### Instructions
Heat oven to 450.  In a square 9 x 9 pan, melt butter in oven. Remove pan from oven and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt and whisk to combine. Add milk and stir just until a dough forms. Turn the mixture out onto a well-floured board.  Sprinkle with additional flour and knead lightly 10 times. Roll and pat into an 8-inch square.

With a floured knife, cut the dough in half, and then cut each half into 9 strips.  Dip each strip in the melted butter to coat both sides, and arrange the strips close together in 2 rows in the pan. 

Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the sticks are golden brown.
