<div class="ingredient-list">

1 cup packed chopped fresh cilantro  
1/3 cup packed chopped fresh mint leaves  
1 fresh jalapeño, minced  
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic

### Instructions
In a food processor, process the coriander, mint, jalapeño, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, cumin, honey, and salt and pepper to taste, until the mixture is nearly pureed, scraping down the sides occasionally. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the yogurt.  Cover and chill until ready to serve.

For the freshest taste, this shouldn’t be made more than 3 hours in advance.
