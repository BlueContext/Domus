title: Lemon Coriander Dill Vinaigrette
serves: "Makes about 1 cup"
summary: "This is good on fish dishes, and great to serve with a platter of smoked salmon on a brunch buffet. You can use standard lemons, but Meyer lemons have a unique aroma that’s really lovely the the dill."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* Juice from 2 Meyer lemons (about ¼ cup)  
* Finely grated zest from one Meyer lemon (about 1 tsp.)  
* 1 tbsp. finely chopped fresh dill  
* ¾ tsp. kosher salt  
* ½ tsp. Dijon mustard  
* 1 tsp. ground coriander seed  
* ½ tsp. sugar  
* Freshly cracked black pepper  
* 6 tablespoons of a mild olive oil or vegetable oil

### Instructions
Put everything except the oil in a medium bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined. Whisking continuously, add the oil in a thin stream. Whisk until the oil is completely incorporated and the mixture takes on the consistency of cream. Adjust seasoning to taste.

This can be made very quickly using an immersion blender – just put everything except the dill (but including the oil) in a bowl or jar and blend until creamy.  Stir in the dill and adjust seasoning to taste.
