I’m sure you can see how many variations could be created by varying the vinegar, spices or herbs. Like Hollandaise, it requires your full attention and can’t be held warm for too long.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 3 egg yolks  
* ¼ cup white wine vinegar or tarragon vinegar  
* ¼ cup dry white vermouth   
* 1 tbsp minced shallots  
* ½ tsp dried tarragon   
* ½ tsp black peppercorns, cracked  
* ¼ tsp salt  
* 4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into cubes and chilled very cold  
* 1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled until just warm

### Instructions
Boil down the vinegar and vermouth with the shallots, tarragon and black peppercorns until reduced to about 2 tbsp. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.

In another saucepan, vigorously whisk the egg yolks for at least a minute (until thick and pale yellow); whisk in the cooled vinegar-wine reduction. Add half of the chilled cubed butter (2 tbsp) – by melting slowly, these will buffer the egg yolks against overcooking. 

Set the pan over low heat and whisk at a moderate pace, watching carefully, for a minute or two. When the egg yolks are thickened and you can see the bottom of the pan between strokes, remove from heat and immediately add the other 2 tbsp of chilled butter cubes – this will stop cooking.

Beat in the warm melted butter a dribble at a time, whisking continually, to make a thick sauce.  Add the salt along with freshly cracked black pepper to taste.  A dash of Tabasco is also nice. 

If the sauce is too cool to serve at this point, you can warm it very carefully over low heat, whisking gently but continually. Do not let it get anywhere near a boil.  Serve immediately.
