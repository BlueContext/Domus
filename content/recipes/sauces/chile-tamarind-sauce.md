### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 lemon grass stalks, trimmed, bottom 8" chopped  
1 large shallot, chopped  
3 tbs vegetable oil  
1 serrano chili, chopped  
1 tbsp tomato paste  
1 tbsp grated fresh ginger  
2 ½ c water

### Instructions
In a medium saucepan over medium, combine the lemon grass, shallot, oil and chili. Cook, stirring, until just beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 

Add the water, tamarind and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the tamarind has softened, about 15 minutes. Off heat, stir in the fish sauce and soy sauce. 

Let the mixture cool slightly, then transfer to a blender. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids; discard the solids. Stir in the lime juice, then taste and season with pepper. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
