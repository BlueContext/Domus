</div>

### Instructions
In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cook until the mixture is reduced to about 3/4 cup and becomes somewhat thick and syrupy. This will take 10-12 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in the chili-garlic sauce.  Cool to room temperature before serving.
