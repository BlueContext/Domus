</div>

### Instructions
In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except the demiglace and gelatin. Simmer for about 30 minutes or more, until 80-90% reduced.

Once well reduced, strain off liquid, pressing down to extract liquid. Discard solids. To liquid, add demi glace & dissolved gelatin. Stir & reduce over med-high heat for 5 minutes or until bubbles are glossy & large. Once there, add pinch of salt if needed & stir to dissolve. Taste to correct seasoning -- a few drops of sherry vinegar might be wanted to brighten it up.
