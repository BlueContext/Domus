This is not a dressing for delicate spring greens, though — you want something crunchy, like romaine or iceberg, or a substantial spinach salad.
### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 carrot  
¼ onion  
A 1” piece of ginger root  
1 ½ tbsp sugar  
1 tbsp white miso  
¼ tsp kosher/sea salt  
freshly ground black pepper (to taste)  
1 tsp toasted sesame oil  
½ cup rice vinegar  
¼ cup neutral-flavored oil  

</div>

### Instructions
Gather all the ingredients.  Peel the carrot and chop it into ½ to 1 inch pieces. Chop onion into 1-inch pieces. Peel the ginger and slice into small pieces. 

Put all the chopped vegetables into the food processor and puree until fine and smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.

Add the remaining ingredients and process until the dressing is smooth. Taste the dressing and adjust with salt. If it's too sour, add a bit more sugar.
