### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

Pan juices from a roast beef  
2 shallots, finely minced  
1/2 c Cognac

2 tbsp drained green peppercorns  
1/3 c heavy cream  

</div>

### Instructions
Skim all but 1 tbsp fat from the roasting pan, add the shallots and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until they are softened.

Add the Cognac and deglaze the pan over moderately high heat, scraping up the brown bits with a wooden spoon.  Add the stock, bring the liquid to a boil, and reduce to about 1 1/2 cups. 

Strain the mixture through a sieve into a heavy saucepan, bring to a boil, and whisk in bits of the beurre manié until the mixture is thickened. Simmer until thickened and no longer tasting of flour.

Flatten 1 tbsp of the green peppercorns with the flat side of a large knife.  Add them to the sauce along with the remaining 1 tbsp of green peppercorns.  Stir in the cream. Simmer the sauce for 3 minutes, add salt and pepper to taste. Correct seasoning with drops of Tabasco or lemon juice as needed.

Transfer the sauce to a heated sauceboat.
