You'll really want to seek out the pickled plums called for here. They're commonly available in Japanese groceries (and online, I'm sure).

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

4 tsp sugar  
3 tbsp hot water  
6 tbsp apricot preserves  
2 salted pickled plum  
1/2 tsp liquid from salted pickled plum jar  
1/4 tsp soy sauce  
1/2 tsp rice vinegar    

</div>

### Instructions
In a small bowl, mix the sugar and hot water until the sugar is dissolved. Add the apricot preserves.

Remove pit from the pickled plum and add to the bowl. The plum is very soft and should fall apart. Then add Â½ teaspoon liquid from the pickled plum jar, soy sauce and rice vinegar.

Mix everything together with a fork until the duck sauce is well-combined. Let the sauce sit for 5 minutes and mix again.
