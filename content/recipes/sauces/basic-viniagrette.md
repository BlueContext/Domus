### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 tbsp. white wine vinegar, or a mixture of wine vinegar and lemon juice  
¼ tsp. salt   
¼ tsp. Dijon mustard  
6 tbsp. olive oil  
1 tbsp. chopped herbs (parsley, chives, tarragon, basil, or some mixture of these, or a pinch of dried thyme leaves)  
1 small clove garlic, peeled and minced very fine (optional)  
Black pepper  

</div>

### Instructions
Using a wire whisk, beat the vinegar (and/or lemon juice) in a bowl with the salt, mustard, garlic (if using) and a generous grinding of black pepper.  Beating continuously, gradually drizzle the oil into the mixture. Beat until the oil is emulsified into the vinegar mixture. 

Alternately, you can place all of the ingredients in a jar and either mix with a stick blender or put the lid tightly on the jar and shake it until the dressing comes together.

Stir in the chopped herbs. Taste and correct seasoning. This is heresy to the French, but I usually add a little pinch of sugar to round out the flavor.
