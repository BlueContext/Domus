### Instructions
Spread the bread cubes on rimmed baking sheets and bake in a slow oven (250 F) until they’re completely dry (about 30 minutes).

Place a 12” skillet or sauté pan over medium high heat and add 3 tbsp. butter. When the butter is hot, add the onions, apples and carrots and cook, stirring, until softened (about 10 minutes). Add the celery and cook, stirring, for an additional 3 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.

Cook the sausage and livers in the skillet, breaking up the sausage with a fork, until the meat is browned and contains no pink, about 10 minutes. Transfer the meats and any remaining fat to the bowl with the vegetables.

Add the remaining 2 tbsp. butter to the pan and place it over high heat. When the butter is very hot, add the chestnuts and cook, tossing frequently, for about 2 minutes. Add the cognac to the pan and ignite.  Deglaze the pan, stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits.  When the flames die back, pour the mixture over the sausage mixture.

In a large bowl, pour the cream-milk mixture over the bread cubes and let them soak, tossing occasionally, for 15 minutes. They should absorb all of the liquid. Gently squeeze out any excess liquid, and stir the bread into the sausage mixture.

Beat the egg and mix with the chicken stock. Mix this liquid into the stuffing along with the herbs, salt, and black pepper to taste.

You can bake this on its own, or stuff your bird(s) with it.  To bake it alone, pour it in a buttered 3-quart baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 20 minutes in the upper third of the oven. Remove the foil and bake until the top is golden and crisp, about 20 more minutes.
