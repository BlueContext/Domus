### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 slice of lemon
* 5 tbsp sugar (or to taste)
* 1/4 c Drambuie (or to taste)
* 1/4 c Irish Whiskey (or to taste)
* 2 c freshly brewed strong black coffee, hot
* 1/2 c cold heavy cream

</div>

### Instructions
Moisten the rim of 2 heatproof glasses with the lemon, and in a small bowl dip the rims in the sugar.

In a chilled bowl, beat the cream until it holds soft peaks. Beat in 1 tbsp of the sugar and beat until it just holds stiff peaks.

In a small saucepan, heat the Drambuie and Irish whiskey, pour the mixture into the glasses and ignite it, swirling the glasses carefully until the sugar caramelizes. Extinguish the flames with the lid and add the coffee. Spoon the cream onto the coffee.
