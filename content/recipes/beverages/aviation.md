summary: "TThis is a pretty and unusual cocktail that does require some possibly hard-to-find ingredients. The special appeal of this cocktail had been lost to history until Rothman & Winter revived the lost manufacture of Crème de Violette (a liqueur colored and flavored with violet blossoms). Fortunately, there are now several companies making Crème de Violette and you should be able to find it at most large liquor stores."
