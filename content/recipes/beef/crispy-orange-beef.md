*Stir fry:*  
1/2 cup peanut oil  
1 yellow onion, cut into large squares

2 pieces of dried tangerine skin, broken in half (optional)

### Instructions
Combine the sliced beef, wine, salt and baking soda in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly with your hands, making sure to evenly coat the beef with the mixture. Let marinate for 15 minutes at room temperature.

Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.  Be sure to have all of your vegetables prepped at this point.

When ready to cook, add the 1/4 cup cornstarch to the beef and mix well to coat evenly.  

Heat the peanut oil in a well-seasoned cast iron pan or wok until it just begins to smoke. Cook the beef in two batches, with no overlapping peices. Cook until the bottom side turns golden brown, about 1 minute.  Flip and cook the second side for 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the rest of the beef.  

Once done, remove all but 1 tbsp oil from the pan.  Stir-fry the onions and peppers until they are just crisp-tender and the onions start to get a bit of color at their edges. Transfer to the same plate as the beef.

Add the ginger, garlic and dried tangerine skin (if using) to the pan, and stir-fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Whisk the sauce to re-combine everything, and pour it into the pan.  Keep stirring it continuously as it thickens.  Return the beef and vegetables to the pan.

As soon as the sauce is thickened and everything is well-coated the dish is done and should be served immediately.  Garnish with sliced scallions if you like.
