### Instructions
In a large bowl, toss the oxtails with the flour, salt and pepper.  Place a large casserole over medium high heat, add the oil and heat until just smoking.  Working in batches, brown the oxtails thoroughly. Don’t crowd the pan, get them brown on all sides, and take your time — this is an important foundation for the final flavor of the dish.

Remove the oxtails to a plate as they are browned.  When they’re all browned, drain all but 2 tbsp of the fat from the pot (or add more olive oil if needed) and add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables sweat and soften.  Add the Cognac or brandy and deglaze the pan.  Add the tomato paste, wine, stock, bay leaf, Provencal herbs, marjoram, savory, thyme, ginger, tangerine peel and shiitake mushrooms.

Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium low, cover and braise for 3 hours or until the oxtails are very tender.

Fish out the bay leaf and strips of tangerine peel.  Skim off as much fat as possible.  Add the vermouth and a dash of orange bitters, and simmer for a few more minutes.

Taste and correct seasoning as needed with salt, black pepper, drops of Tabasco or a pinch of sugar.
