### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

3 lb beef shoulder or chuck roast, tied  
3 tbsp olive oil  
2 cups beef stock  
2 cups dry red wine  
1 bunch parsley, chopped fine  
7 whole cloves  
1 bay leaf  
2 1/2 cups coarsely chopped yellow onions  
2 cups  peeled 1” carrot chunks  
8 medium potatoes, scrubbed and cut into thirds  
2 cups canned San Marzano tomatoes   
1 cup diced celery

### Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Rub the roast with salt and black pepper.  Heat the olive oil in a heavy flameproof casserole or Dutch oven and sear the roast for several minutes on each side, or until well-browned.

Pour in the stock and wine, and mix in the parsley, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, the bay leaf, and the whole cloves.  Add the onions, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes and celery. The liquid in the casserole should just cover the vegetables — add a bit of additional beef stock or water if it does not. Bring to a simmer, cover, and bake for 2 1/2 hours.

Uncover and cook until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours more, basting frequently.

Remove from the oven, cover loosely, and allow to rest for 20 minutes or so.

Transfer the meat to a deep serving platter and arrange the vegetables around it. Spoon a bit of sauce over all, and garnish with some additional chopped parsley. Pass additional sauce in a bowl or gravy boat.
