### Instructions
#### Make the marinade:   
Combine all marinade ingredients in a resealable plastic bag. Cut the tri-tip in half, and place in the marinade. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 4-8 hours.

#### For the tacos:
Grill the marinated tri-tip until done to your liking (you definitely want it at least a bit pink — “well-done” will be miserable) and set aside, lightly covered, to rest for 10-15 minutes.  Slice thinly against the grain. 

Serve with warm tortillas and whatever salsa or other condiments you prefer.
