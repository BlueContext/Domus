Peppadew is a specific brand of sweet and spicy pickled peppers from South Africa. The peppers themselves are a unique variety with a gentle heat, and the sweet-tangy brine matches the heat level perfectly. They’re easily had online if you can't find them at your store. You can use sweet pepperoncini instead, but it won’t be quite the same, and I find Peppadew peppers to be an indispensable secret ingredient that’s well worth keeping on hand.
### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 tsp. ground fennel seed   
* Kosher salt, black pepper   
* 1 lb skirt or flank steak, trimmed   
* 7 tbsp olive oil   
* 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice   
* 1/3 drained and chopped Peppadew peppers (or sweet pepperoncini)   
* 1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced   
* 8 oz. baby arugula   
* 1.5 oz parmesan, shaved (about 1/2 cup)

### Instructions
In a small bowl, combine the fennel, 1 tsp salt, and 2 tsp pepper. Rub the steak all over with this mixture and let sit at room temp for 15 minutes. 

In a liquid measuring cup, combine 6 tbsp of the oil with the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Whisk thoroughly and set aside. 

In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, heat the remaining tbsp of oil until just smoking. Add the steak and sear on both sides until well-browned, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 10 min.  Add any juices from the steak to the dressing. 

Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the Peppadews and garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add half of the dressing to the skillet, scraping the pan to deglaze. Remove from heat. 

In a large bowl, toss the arugula with the remaining dressing and half of the parmesan shavings.  Divide the greens among 4 plates.  Slice the steak thinly against the grain, and arrange slices over arugula. Spoon the pan sauce over each plate, and top with remaining parmesan curls.
