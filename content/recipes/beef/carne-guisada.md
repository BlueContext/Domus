### Introduction

There’s nothing particularly unusual about my version of this Tex-Mex classic (which I think I got from a local Junior League cookbook), but it’s awfully good.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/2 cup oil  
2 lbs round steak, cut into 1” pieces   
1 bell pepper, chopped  
1 small onion, chopped  
2 tbsp flour  
3/4 tsp garlic powder  
1/2 tbsp black pepper  
3/4 tbsp ground cumin  
1 8 oz can tomato sauce  
Salt to taste  
2 cup water  
Warm flour tortillas to serve

### Instructions

In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat and brown the meat very thoroughly in batches, removing the meat to a plate as it is done.

When the meat is done, add the onion and bell pepper to the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another minute or so. Add the flour and keep cooking until the flour starts to brown. 

Return the meat and any accumulated juices to the pot, and stir vigorously to combine everything. Add the garlic, pepper, cumin, and 1 tsp salt. Stir in the tomato sauce and water.

Once this mixture comes to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low. Partially cover the pot and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat is very tender (about 1 hour). Serve with hot flour tortillas.
