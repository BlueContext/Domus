The meat counter at my grocery store sometimes has beef cut specifically for “paupiettes”, which is very convenient. But any butcher will surely be able to provide you with slices from the top round or chuck, about 1/2” thick. You can pound them out yourself.  If you can produce slices about 10” by 6”, one slice per person will suffice. If they’re smaller, like a scalopini cut, plan on two pieces per person.  
### Ingredients

4 slices top round of beef, 10-12” by 6-7” and 3/8” thick

### Instructions
One by one, place each piece of beef between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a mallet or rolling pin.  This is to break down some of the fibers in the meat, and also to thin the slices to their desired thickness if needed.  Lay out flat, seasoning the tops with salt, pepper, and a bit of thyme or oregano.

#### Make the stuffing
Cook the onions and herbs with 3 tbsp of oil in a frying pan for 8-10 minutes over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until tender and beginning to brown. Stir in the peppers and cook, stirring, 4-5 more minutes. Scoop into a mixing bowl, and wipe the pan clean.

Spread both sides of the rye bread with the mustard.  Film the pan with more oil, and fry the bread until lightly browned on both sides. Dice the bread and add it to the bowl, along with the garlic, egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to combine.  Divide the stuffing into 4 (or however many slices of meat you have).

#### Prepare the rolls
Spread one portion of the stuffing over each slice of beef, leaving an inch margin on the end that will be on the outside of the roll and 1/2 inch on each side. Roll the meat up to enclose the stuffing. Secure the roll with 2-3 toothpicks, or truss it up with string.

#### Cooking and braising
Preheat the oven to 450F.

Film the bottom of a heavy casserole (Dutch oven) with oil and place over moderately high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place the meat seam-side up in the casserole. Strew the sliced onions and carrots around. Brown over moderate heat, loosening bottom of meat from casserole with a thin spatula occasionally.  Set uncovered in the hot oven to brown the top and sides, basting ever 5 minutes or so, for 15 minutes. Remove from oven.

Reduce oven temperature to 325F. Season the meat with salt, pepper, and herbs. Pour in the wine and enough stock to bring the liquid 1/2 up the side of the meat. Bring to a simmer.  Place a sheet of foil over the pot, and then cover with the lid.  Place the casserole back in the oven. Baste several times as it cooks, regulating the heat so that the liquid only gently simmers.  It will probably take 2 hours, but the dish is done when a paring knife pierces the meat very easily.

#### Serving
When the meat is tender, remove the casserole from the oven. Remove the rolls to a plate, remove the toothpicks or string, and tent with foil to keep warm. 

Strain the cooking liquid into a saucepan, pressing on the solids. Skim off the fat.  You should have a scant 2 cups of sauce.  If you’d like it thicker, add the cornstarch mixture and simmer for 2 minutes.  Right before serving, stir in the butter and a pinch of minced parsley. 

Spoon a bit of the sauce over the meat, and serve the rest in a bowl on the side.
