### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

3 tbsp. white or red miso  
1 tbsp soy sauce  
1 tbsp chili-garlic paste  
1 tbsp white sugar  
2 tsp toasted sesame oil  
2 tsp finely grated fresh ginger  
2 cloves garlic, finely grated or very finely minced  
1.5 lbs skirt steak or sirloin flap steak, trimmed and cut crosswise into 5-6" pieces, patted dry  
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar  
Vegetable oil (5 tsp total)  
3 scallions, sliced thinly (green and white parts)

### Instructions
In a medium bowl, whisk together the miso, soy sauce, chili-garlic paste, sugar, sesame oil, ginger and garlic to combine thoroughly. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the mixture in a separate bowl.  Add the steak to the remaining mixture, turning to coat, and let it sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.

To the reserved tablespoon of the miso mixture, add the rice wine vinegar and 2 tsp of vegetable oil. Stir to combine and set aside.

Place a large, heavy skillet (cast iron works well) over high heat and add 1 tbsp vegetable oil.

Remove the steak from the bowl and pat with paper towels to remove excess miso mixture.  When the oil begins to smoke, add the steak to the pan.  If you can put it all in without crowding it, do so -- otherwise, do two batches. Cook without disturbing until well-browned on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip the pieces and cook until the second side is well-browned and the thickest part reaches an interior temperature of 125 (medium-rare) to 130 (medium) degrees F (another 2 or 3 minutes).  Transfer the steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil; rest for 10 minutes.

Stir any accumulated meat juices on the platter into the reserved miso-vinegar mixture.  Cut the steak against the grain and on the bias into thin slices.  Place a serving platter and scatter scallions over the top. Serve with the miso sauce.
