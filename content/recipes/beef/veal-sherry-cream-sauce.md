### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lb veal cutlets, pounded between sheets of wax paper until 1/4 inch thick  
Flour for dredging  
1/4 c clarified butter  
2 shallots, minced  
A pinch of caraway seeds  
1/4 c dry Sherry  
1/2 c white vermouth  
2 c heavy cream  
1 tbsp parsley, minced  

</div>

### Instructions
Pat the veal dry, season it with salt and pepper, and dredge it in flour, shaking off the excess. In a large heavy skillet, heat the clarified butter over moderate heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Increase heat to medium high, add the veal in batches, and the caraway seeds. Brown the veal, transferring them to a plate when they are browned. 

Add the sherry and wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up browned bits. Reduce liquid by half. Add the cream and reduce the liquid over moderate heat until it is thickened slightly. Return the veal to the pan, coating and warming it in the simmering sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with the minced parsley.
