### Instructions
In a blender, combine the garlic, soy, vinegar, oil, red pepper flakes, sugar and salt, and blend well. In a strong zip-lock plastic bag, pour the marinade over the London broil. Seal the bag, forcing out as much air as possible, and let the meat marinate at room temperature, turning occasionally, for 1 hour (or covered and chilled, turning occasionally, overnight).

Grill the London broil, drained, over hot coals, or broil it on the oiled broiler rack under a preheated broiler about 1‚Äù from the heat for 8-10 minutes on each side (130 F in the center for medium-rare). 

Transfer to a cutting board and let it rest, tented in foil, for 10 minutes. Slice thin at a 45 degree angle. Serve with Ravigote sauce.

The meat can be cooked but not sliced 1 day in advance, and kept covered and chilled.
