### Instructions
#### Make the marinade
In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, chopped garlic and black pepper. Grate the apple into the mixture, and stir to combine thoroughly. 

Add the vegetables to the marinade and stir to coat.  Add the meat to the marinade, being careful to separate every slice. Mix everything together thoroughly with your hands. 

Set aside for at least 30 minutes, or (better) refrigerate overnight. 

#### Make the bulgogi
In a large heavy skillet (cast iron works well), heat 1 tbsp sesame oil over high heat until on the verge of smoking.  Cook the marinated mixture in a single layer, working in batches if necessary, until cooked through (about 4-5 minutes). There should be some browning on the meat, and charred spots on the vegetables. 

Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with sticky rice.
