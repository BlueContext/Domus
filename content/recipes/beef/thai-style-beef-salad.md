This calls for grilling the meat, and grilling it over lump charcoal adds a real dimension of flavor. But it definitely can be seared to doneness in a cast-iron skillet over high heat. In fact, I suspect this is preferable to grilling over gas.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 large shallot, sliced thin  
* 1 Serrano or jalapeno, sliced very thin (optional)  
* 3 tbsp lime juice (from two limes)  
* 4 tsp (packed) brown sugar   
* 1 ½ tsp salt  
* ½ tsp white pepper  
* 1.5 lbs skirt steak, trimmed and cut into 2 or 3 pieces   
* 3 tbsp fish sauce  
* 1 tsp (or more) red pepper flakes (or a couple of tsp of Sambal Oelek)  
* 1 ½ cups (~7oz) cherry tomatoes, halved  
* 1 red or yellow bell pepper, sliced thin and cut in half crosswise  
* 3-4 cups sliced romaine lettuce  
* ½ cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro  
* ½ cup coarsely chopped fresh mint

### Instructions
In a large bowl, combine the shallots, Serrano and lime juice and let sit for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons of sugar, the salt, and white pepper. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, then rub all over with the sugar-salt mixture.

Prepare a grill for very high heat. For a charcoal grill, spread a full chimney of hot coals evenly over half of the grill bed. For a gas grill, set all burners to an even, high flame. Heat the grill until hot, about 5 minutes, then clean and oil the cooking grate. Grill the steak (directly over the coals, if using a charcoal grill) until charred all over and cooked to desired doneness, 2 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare (depending on the thickness of the steak). Transfer the steak to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, add the fish sauce, pepper flakes, and remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar to the shallot-lime juice mixture and stir until the sugar has dissolved. 

Slice the steak against the grain and on a steep bias, as thinly as you can manage; cut any very long strips in half (we want bite-sized).  Transfer the steak to the bowl along with any accumulated juices. Add the tomatoes, bell pepper, romaine, cilantro, and mint and fold to combine. 

Transfer to a platter, garnish with cilantro sprigs, if desired, and serve.
