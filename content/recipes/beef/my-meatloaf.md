It’s tender and flavorful enough that I generally bake it unglazed and serve without a sauce. If you like the traditional ketchup topping, feel free to add it. Alternately, this is delicious served with a brown gravy with mushrooms.

A mixture of beef, veal and pork is the key to the best meatloaf (and meatballs). Half beef, half pork is better than beef alone, but the addition of veal really makes it superb in both texture and flavor. Buy 1 lb of each, and freeze the other half -- it's the perfect amount to make a really good spaghetti and meatballs.

The addition of Swiss cheese may seem strange here, but trust me — the final product won’t be “cheesy” or taste like Swiss, but it will add moisture, impart a savory flavor, and help the sides and bottom brown deliciously. Heinz Chili Sauce has been around as long as the ketchup, but is less well-known these days. It’s very similar to ketchup, but with additional spices and less sugar. Despite the name, it’s…really not spicy at all. Your grocery store almost certainly carries it, but ketchup may be substituted. 

Finally, Tiger Sauce is a spicy-sweet condiment available at most grocery stores. It’s totally optional here (just replace it with more chili sauce or ketchup), but adds a great tangy kick.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/2 lb ground beef chuck  
1/2 lb ground veal  
1/2 lb ground pork  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1 large onion, finely chopped  
1 large red or orange bell pepper, finely diced  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
1 cup panko bread crumbs  
1/3 cup Heinz Chili Sauce or ketchup  
1 tbsp Tiger Sauce (optional)  
2 oz finely grated Parmesan cheese (1/2 cup)  
2 oz finely shredded Jarlsberg or Swiss cheese (1/2 cup)  
1 tbsp dry Sherry  
3 large eggs  
1 tsp dried thyme  
1 tsp smoked or ordinary paprika  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp black pepper

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 9” x 5” loaf pan.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and cook, stirring, until softened (7-8 minutes). Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.

Add the remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl. Knead the mixture with your hands until it is well-blended, but no further. Fill the prepared loaf pan with the mixture, mounding it slightly. 

Place the loaf pan on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any grease that might bubble over. Bake for around 1 hour 15 minutes, until the meatloaf is firm to the touch and has shrunk away from the sides of the pan. The internal temperature should be 160F. 

Carefully pour off any excess fat, and let the meatloaf stand for 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edges and carefully turn out the meatloaf onto a cutting board for slicing.  It’s quite tender, so be gentle!
