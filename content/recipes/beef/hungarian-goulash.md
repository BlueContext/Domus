True goulash celebrates the delicious taste of the chronically under-appreciated spice paprika. If your paprika has been in your pantry for years, this is the time to buy a new tin of good, imported Hungarian paprika (either sweet or hot works fine, and “hot” isn’t really very hot).

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 slices bacon, chopped  
1 1/2 lbs boneless beef chuck, trimmed and cut into 1/2” cubes  
2 tbsp oil  
2 medium onions, chopped fine  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
2 tbsp paprika (sweet, or a mixture of sweet and hot)  
1 scant tsp caraway seeds  
Scant 1/4 cup flour   
1/8 cup red wine vinegar  
1/8 cup tomato paste  
2 1/2 cups beef stock  
2 1/2 cups water  
Salt and black pepper to taste  
1 large red bell pepper, chopped fine  
2 large russet potatoes

### Instructions
Pat the beef dry with paper towels, season it all over with salt and pepper, and sprinkle it with a bit of flour.
In a large dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat, stirring, until crisp and transfer to small bowl with a slotted spoon. In the fat remaining in the pan, brown the beef cubes in small batches over medium-high heat. As they become browned, transfer them to a bowl and set aside.

Reduce heat to medium and add the oil.  Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until golden. Stir in the paprika, caraway seeds, and flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the vinegar and tomato paste and cook, whisking, for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, water, salt, and bell peppers. Return the bacon and beef to the pot along with any accumulated juices. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt.

Bring the goulash to a boil and reduce heat until just simmering. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally (this is important — it wants to stick to the bottom!), for 45 minutes.  (The soup can be prepared to this point up to 2 days in advance. Cool to room temperature before chilling, covered, in the refrigerator.)

Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2” cubes. Add potatoes to the goulash and simmer, covered and stirring occasionally, until tender — about 30 minutes more. Season the soup to taste with salt and pepper, and serve in shallow bowls.
