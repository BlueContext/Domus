### Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Pound the steak or score it lightly on both sides. 

In a skillet, heat the butter, add the onion and garlic and cook until lightly browned. Add the mushrooms and cook 3 minutes. Add the nuts, parsley, bread cubes, poultry seasoning, salt, pepper and egg and mix. 

Spread the mixture on the steak. Roll lengthwise, as for jelly roll, and tie with string at 2 inch intervals. 

Brown the meat on both sides in a little fat in a skillet or heavy Dutch oven. Add the liquid, cover and bake two hours. To serve, cut into one-inch slices and serve with the pan drippings.
