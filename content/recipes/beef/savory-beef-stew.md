### Instructions
Have your ingredients chopped, sliced and measured before you begin. Season the beef with salt and pepper on all sides.

Add the oil to a heavy dutch oven over high heat. When the oil just begins to smoke, add the beef in batches, browning heavily on all sides.  Remove to a plate and set aside.

Lower the heat to medium and add all vegetables. Cook for 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are soft. Stir in the tomato paste and anchovy until well distributed.  Return the beef and its juices to the pot. Add the wine, vinegar, tomatoes and their juice. Bring to boil.  Add stock to cover (you may need a bit more than 3 cups).  Add 1 tsp. salt, the bay leaves, and thyme. Return to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, partially covered, for 2-3 hours until the meat is fork-tender. Cool to room temperature, and then cover and refrigerate. When cold, skim off the solidified fat at the top. Reheat over low heat, letting the stew simmer for 30 minutes before serving. 

Mix in half of the parsley, and use the rest to sprinkle over each serving.
