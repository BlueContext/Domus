### Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 F and position a rack in the lower middle. 

In a blender puree the garlic, ginger and chili peppers with 1/3 cup of water.

In a large flame-proof casserole, heat 3 tbsp oil over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Brown the lamb thoroughly in batches, transferring to a plate as it is browned.

Add the remaining 3 tbsp of oil and heat until shimmering. Fry the cinnamon, cloves and bay leaf, stirring constantly, until the cloves are puffed slightly (about 30 seconds).

Add the onions and cook the mixture over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden.  Add the garlic-ginger-chili puree and cook, stirring, until the liquid is evaporated.

Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric, curry powder, garam masala and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.

Add the tomatoes, yogurt and simmer the mixture, stirring well to combine, for 1 minute. Add the lamb with any accumulated juices, the salt and 1 cup of water. Stir and bring mixture to a simmer.

Cover pot and braise the mixture in the oven at 350 F for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is fork-tender.

This dish may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance. Let the lamb cool, uncovered, then cover and chill. Reheat the lamb mixture gently and proceed with the remaining steps.

Remove the pot from the oven, pile the spinach into the mixture, and cover.  Let the pot sit, covered, for 2 minutes.  Stir the mixture thoroughly. If the spinach is not yet fully wilted, simmer the mixture over low heat for a minute or two. 

Add lemon juice 1 tsp at a time, to taste, and correct seasoning with salt and pepper. Transfer the stew to a heated serving dish and sprinkle with the toasted pine nuts.
