serves: "Serves 4-6"
summary: "This is another old recipe the long-gone Barcelona Cafe on Broadway. These benefit from being grilled over hardwood charcoal, but be careful not to overcook -- lamb should never be well-done."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 lbs boned leg of lamb, cut into 1” cubes  
* 1 cup olive oil  
* 2 tbsp chopped garlic  
* 1/4 cup chopped parsley  
* 1 tsp salt  
* 1 tsp pepper  
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes  
* 1 tsp dried oregano  
* 1 tsp ground cumin  
* 1 tsp paprika  
* Chopped parsley and a few rosemary sprigs, to garnish

### Instructions
In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, parsley, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, cumin and paprika. Add the lamb cubes, combine to coat, cover and marinate for at least 12 hours (24 hours is better).

Thread lamb onto metal or bamboo skewers (soak bamboo skewers in water for several hours before using to prevent burning).  Grill to desired doneness (about 15 minutes — lamb is best medium-rare).

To serve, sprinkle with chopped parsley and garnish with sprigs of rosemary. 

These are also nice served over rice, and a yogurt-dill sauce makes a nice accompaniment.
