The crème de cassis is optional, but something of a secret ingredient here. It's a sweet, lightly alcoholic liqueur made in France from black currents. It's available in American liquor stores, not terribly expensive, and somehow brings out the rich and luscious qualities of the blueberries. Bonus: a tablespoon in a glass of champagne or dry white wine makes a fantastic drink for festive occasions.

### Instructions

Heat the oven to 400°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

Mix the blueberries, 1/2 cup of sugar, the flour, lemon zest, and cassis in a large bowl. Carefully ease one of the rolled out pie-crusts into a 9" pie plate, making sure not to stretch or pull on the dough. With a sharp knife, cut the excess dough off at the edge of the pie plate. Spoon the blueberry mixture into the pie shell, scraping the bowl to get all the juices. 

Brush the edge of the pie shell with egg wash.  Carefully lay the second crust on top, again easing -- not stretching -- it onto the pie. Trim the excess dough at the edge. Press the edges together with the tines of a dinner fork. Brush the top of the crust with egg wash, cut three slits for steam to escape, and sprinkle with sugar.

Place the pie on the prepared sheet pan and bake in the middle of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until the filling is very bubbly and the crust is nicely browned. Allow to cool and serve just warm or at room temperature.
