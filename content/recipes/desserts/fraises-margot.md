title:  Fraises Margot (Strawberry Bavarian Mousse) 
serves: "Serves 4-6"
summary: "This may be my favorite dessert. If you can find some decent strawberries, it will taste like the sweetness of summer itself. And while it requires some forethought (and 5 hours of chilling time), it’s very simple – it doesn’t even require any actual cooking, other than melting a bit of gelatin over some hot water."

### Instructions
Chill a mixing bowl for whipping cream.

Rinse and dry the strawberries. Set aside 10 small, perfect berries for garnish, hull the remainder and puree them in a food processor. Work the puree through a sieve. Set half of it aside for the coulis. Add 1 c. of confectioners’ sugar, the juice of 1 lemon and the kirsch to the remaining puree.

Sprinkle the gelatin over the water in a small heatproof bowl and let it stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Bring 2-3” water to a simmer in a small saucepan. Set the bowl of softened gelatin in the hot water and let stand until the gelatin is completely melted. Whisk the liquid gelatin into the strawberry puree, stirring vigorously to fully and carefully incorporate the gelatin (to avoid any lumps).

In a chilled mixing bowl and using the whisk attachment for your mixer, beat the cream until it forms soft peaks. Gently fold in the strawberry mixture with a wooden spoon, just until fully incorporated.

Sprinkle the inside of a metal charlotte mold with cold water. Invert and tap out the excess. Cut out a round of parchment paper the diameter of the bottom of the mold and line the mold with it. Pour in the strawberry-cream mixture and smooth the surface with a spatula.  Cover the mold with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 4 to 5 hours.

To make the coulis, combine the remaining puree with ¾ c. confectioners’ sugar and the juice of ½ lemon. Whisk thoroughly to combine. Mix in a small splash of kirsch if you like. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To unmold the dessert, dip the mold into very hot water for a few seconds.  Run the blade of a small, thin knife around the inside of the mold. Invert a platter over the mold and quickly reverse them both. The dessert should dislodge from the mold. Peel off the paper circle and discard.

Spoon a little of the strawberry coulis around the base of the mousse. Decorate the top with the reserved strawberries. Pass the remaining coulis in a bowl or sauceboat when you cut the mousse into serving portions.
