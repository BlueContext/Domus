</div>

### Instructions
In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the yolks and 2 tbsp of the sugar for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is very thick and pale, beat in the lemon juice and zest, and the gin, and beat the mixture for 3 more minutes.

In another bowl with clean beaters beat the whites with a pinch of salt until they hold soft peaks, beat in the remaining tbsp sugar and beat until they just hold stiff peaks. 

Add the whites to the yolks. The the egg-white bowl, beat the cream just until it holds stiff peaks.  

Fold the whites into the yolk mixture and fold in the whipped cream gently but thoroughly. Spoon the mousse into 2 chilled stemmed glasses and chill for 30-45 minutes.
