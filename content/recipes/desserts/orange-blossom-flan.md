### Instructions
#### Make the Caramel:
Combine sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to wash down any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan.  Cook of medium heat without stirring until the mixture is a light amber color. Pour into a 4-cup souffle dish and set aside.

#### Make the Custard:
Place the milk and zest in a small saucepan. Bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, cover, remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes to steep.  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the egg, yolk and sugar, beating until pale and fluffy. Whisking continuously, pour the milk into the eggs and mix very thoroughly. Add the orange blossom water, the Grand Marnier and the salt, and stir to combine. Let stand for a few minutes and skim the foam from the top.

Place the souffle dish in a deep baking pan and pour in enough hot water to reach half-way up the side of the souffle dish. Pour the custard mixture over the caramel and bak until the flan is just set (it should tremble slightly at the center when shaken, and a small knife will come out of the center clean), about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and remove the souffle dish from the hot water. 

Let stand for at least 30 minutes before serving, or refrigerate loosely covered and serve cold.
