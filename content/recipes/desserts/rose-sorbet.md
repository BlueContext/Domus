### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 2 1/2 cups medium-dry rosé wine
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
* Mint sprigs to garnish

</div>

### Instructions
In a saucepan, bring the wine to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour into a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice to cool.

In the pan, combine the sugar and one cup of water. Simmer and stir until the sugar is fully dissolved. Stir the syrup into the wine and let stand, stirring occasionally, until it’s cold. Stir in the lemon juice and freeze in an ice-cream freezer.

Transfer the sorbet to a container and freeze until firm.

To serve, garnish scoops with sprigs of mint.
