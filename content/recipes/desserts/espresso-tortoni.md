### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 1 large egg white at room temperature
* A pinch of cream of tartar
* 4 tbsp sugar
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 tbsp instant espresso powder
* 2 tbsp Kahlua (a coffee liqueur)
* 4 tbsp crushed amaretti (Italian almond cookies)
* 18 chocolate-covered coffee beans (an optional, but lovely, garnish)

### Instructions
In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg white with a pinch of salt until frothy; add the cream of tartar and whip until it holds soft peaks. Add 1 tbsp of sugar, a bit at a time, while whipping until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks.

In a chilled bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream with espresso powder until it begins to thicken. Add the Kahlua and remaining 3 tbsp sugar, and whip just until it holds stiff peaks.

Stir 1/3 of the whipped cream mixture to the egg whites. Gently but thoroughly fold in the rest of the whipped cream with 2 1/2 tbsp of the crushed amaretti.

Spoon the mixture into 6 1/2 cup ramekins, coffee cups, or other dishes, smoothing the tops.  Sprinkle the remaining crushed amaretti crumbs over the tops, cover tightly, and freeze for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

Top each tortoni with 2-3 chocolate-covered coffee beans before serving. The frozen mixture is soft enough to eat right out of the freezer, so there’s no need to let them “soften”.
