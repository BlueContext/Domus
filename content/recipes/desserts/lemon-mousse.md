### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 3 eggs, separated
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 envelope unflavored gelatin
* ¼ cup cold water
* ½ cup fresh lemon juice
* 2 tsp. lemon zest
* 1 cup heavy cream (chilled)

</div>

### Instructions
Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water in a small heatproof bowl. In a double-boiler (or a metal or glass bowl set over – not in – simmering water) whisk to combine the egg yolks, ½ c. of sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest. Cook over simmering water until slightly thickened, stirring constantly and regulating the heat carefully.

When thickened, remove from heat and stir in the gelatin very thoroughly. Turn the mixture out into a large bowl and set aside to cool (but don’t allow it to set).

Beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Add the remaining sugar and continue beating until they form stiff peaks.  

In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form.

Fold the egg whites and the whipped cream gently but thoroughly into the lemon mixture. Pour the mixture into an oiled 6 cup (or larger) mold, or into individual serving dishes.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for several hours or overnight.

If the mixture was chilled in a mold, run a very thin knife blade around the inside rim of the mold and set the mold in very hot water for a few seconds. Invert on a plate to unmold.

This dish may be prepared in advance, and can be frozen without ill effect.

If you like, serve the mousse with macerated berries and some additional whipped cream.
