I like to include a bell pepper, which as far as I know isn't traditional at all. The basic idea is roughly equal amounts of the each vegetable, a small handful of fresh mint, and a light dressing of lemon or lime juice and olive oil. The vegetables should all be cut into the same small (¼") dice.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 4 small Persian cucumbers (or 1 English), diced  
* 3 Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced  
* ½ of a medium red onion, diced, soaked briefly in cold water, and drained  
* 4 red radishes, trimmed and diced  
* 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced  
* 1 small handful fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped, or 2 tsp dried mint  
* 3 tbsp fresh lemon or lime juice  
* 1 tbsp olive oil  
* Salt and pepper   

</div>

### Instructions
Combine all of the diced vegetables and the chopped mint.

In a small bowl, mix the lemon/lime juice, olive oil, a big pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Pour over the salad and toss to evenly distribute everything.

This probably tastes best if served immediately, but I love to chill it for 30 minutes or so, and it will still be tasty if held overnight.
