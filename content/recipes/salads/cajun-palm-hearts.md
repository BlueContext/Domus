### Instructions
#### Prepare the salad
Make the vinaigrette (see below).

Drain the hearts of palm and slice them in 1/2” lengths. Mix with the beans, celery, parsley, scallions, eggs, and capers. Add enough of the vinaigrette to  moisten the mixture. Chill for 15 minutes or so.

Arrange on a bed of lettuce and garnish with sliced tomatoes. Pour the remaining vinaigrette over the salad and serve.

#### Prepare the vinaigrette
Mix all ingredients thoroughly and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so, to let the flavors combine.

In a non-reactive bowl, combine the cucumbers and the dressing and marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour (and up to 2 hours — after that, the cucumber skins will discolor, but this will not change the taste).
