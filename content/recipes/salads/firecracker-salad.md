You can make this ahead of time, but you'll need to reserve the blanched and julienned snow peas, and toss them in at the last minute. Otherwise, they'll lose their bright green color.
### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

3/4 lb snow peas, trimmed and stringed  
1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2 inch long julienne  
1 large yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2 inch long julienne  
1 large jalape√±o pepper, seeded and julienned  
1 1/3 cups of jicama that has been peeled and cut into 1 1/2 inch long julienne  
2 tbsp lemon juice  
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar  
2 tsp finely grated ginger  
1 tsp honey  
1/3 c olive oil  
Pinch of crushed red pepper or Aleppo pepper (optional)  
Pinch of ground sumac (optional)  
Salt and pepper to taste  

</div>

### Instructions
In a saucepan of boiling water blanch the snow peas for 15 seconds, drain them, and plunge them into a bowl of ice water to stop cooking. Drain them well and cut them diagonally into thin slices.

In a bowl, toss the snow peas with the bell peppers, jalapeno and jicama. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, vineagar, ginger, honey, salt and pepper to taste, optional red pepper to taste, and add the olive oil slowly, whisking continually until emulsified. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well.
