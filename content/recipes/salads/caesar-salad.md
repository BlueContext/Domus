summary: "Every cook should be able to produce this simple and delicious dressing. I like to use whole leaves of romaine for my Caesar salad.  It preserves the crispness of the lettuce and gives the dish a dramatic, structural appearance."

### Instructions
Chop together anchovy fillets, garlic, and pinch of salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in Parmesan. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. (This can be done 1 day in advance.)

Make the croutons: Preheat the oven to 375. Toss the bread with olive oil on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden and crunchy (10-15 minutes).

Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing. Top with grated or shaved Parmesan to taste.
