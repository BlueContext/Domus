This is so simple that the quality of your oranges will matter. When they're at their best in the summer, this really shines.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

4 navel oranges  
1/4 cup sugar  
3 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
1 1/2 tsp orange blossom water  

</div>

### Instructions
Cut away the peel and pith of the oranges with a sharp knife, and cut the oranges crosswise into 1/4‚Äù slices.  Arrange the slices, overlapping slightly, on a platter. Sprinkle the oranges with sugar, lemon juice and the orange blossom water.
