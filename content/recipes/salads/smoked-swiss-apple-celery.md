### Instructions
In a blender, blend the caraway seeds, mustard, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. With the motor running, add the oil in the thin stream and blend until emulsified. Blend in the parsley.

In a bowl, toss the cheese and celery with 2/3 of the dressing.

Core the apples, quarter them, and slice them thinly. In a different bowl, toss the apple slices with the remaining dressing until they are coated evenly.

Arrange the apple slices decoratively on each of 4 salad plates, and divide the cheese and celery mixture among them. Drizzle any remaining dressing over the plates and garnish with celery leaves.
