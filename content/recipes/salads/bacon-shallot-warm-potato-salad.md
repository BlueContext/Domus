### Instructions
Place the potatoes in Dutch oven and cover by 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender (a paring knife can be slipped into and out of the center of the potatoes with very little resistance), about 15-25 minutes.

Drain the potatoes in a colander and cut them into 1‚Äù chunks as soon as you can handle them. Transfer to a large bowl and sprinkle 1-2 tbsp of the vinegar over the cut potatoes while still hot. Toss gently.

Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve on a plate lined with paper towels.

Stir the shallots into the skillet with the bacon fat and fry until starting to brown and crisp. Remove from heat.

In a medium bowl, combine the mustards, the remaining vinegar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper, and whisk thoroughly. Add the shallots and bacon drippings. 

Add the potatoes and bacon and immediately toss to coat everything with the dressing. Adjust seasoning to taste. Garnish with parsley and more vinegar if you like, and serve warm to room-temperature.
