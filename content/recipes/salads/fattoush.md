Don’t skip ingredients just because you can't find them at your market! Zaatar, pomegranate molasses, and sumac can be found at a Middle Eastern market, or (more easily) online, and are all handy to have in the kitchen.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lb seedless red grapes, washed and halved
1/4 cup cider or sherry vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp Zaatar 
2 8-inch pita bread rounds, each split into two rounds
1/2 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh dill
1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
2 tsp ground sumac 
1 English cucumber, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced
1 romaine heart (6-7 ounces), chopped into bite-sized pieces
1 cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped

### Instructions
Heat the oven to 400 F with rack in middle position. In a medium bowl, stir together the grapes, vinegar, and 1/2 tsp salt. Cover and refrigerate. 

In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 cup of the olive oil with the garlic, cumin, pepper flakes and zaatar. Arrange the pita rounds rough-side up on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush each round with the flavored oil, using all of it. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until brown and crisp, about 10-12 minutes. Set aside to cool.  When they are cool enough to handle, break them into bite-size pieces and set aside.

Drain the grapes, reserving the pickling liquid. In a large bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of oil, the yogurt, dill, molasses, sumac, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the reserved pickling liquid and whisk well. 

When you’re ready to serve, add the cucumber, romain, mint, grapes and pita pieces. Toss until evenly coated and serve immediately. Don’t mix everything ahead of time — the pita “croutons” will get soggy.
