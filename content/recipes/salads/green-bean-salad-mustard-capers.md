### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 lbs green beans, trimmed (haricot vert are very nice here)  
2 tbsp drained capers  
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
1 tbsp Dijon mustard (or to taste — I like a bit more)  
1/2 cup olive oil   

</div>

### Instructions
In a kettle of boiling salted water, cook the green beans for 5 minutes. Promptly drain them and plunge them into cold water with ice. This technique preserves the color of the beans, and halts their cooking at just the right crisp-tender stage.

In a blender, puree the capers with the lemon juice, mustard, and 2 tbsp water. With the motor running, add the oil in a stream and blend until emulsified. Season to taste, but note that capers are very salty so you’re unlikely to need more salt.

This can all be done a day in advance. Just cover the beans and the dressing, and keep them chilled.

To serve, toss the beans with the dressing in a large bowl until they’re coated evenly.  Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
