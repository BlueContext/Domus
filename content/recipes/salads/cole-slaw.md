Salting the cabbage removes excess water and prevents watery slaw.

### Instructions
Salt cabbage: Toss cabbage, pepper, celery, onion, and salt in colander set over bowl. Let stand until wilted, about 1 hour. Rinse cabbage mixture thoroughly under cold water, drain, and dry well with kitchen towel.

Whisk mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, sugar, cayenne pepper, Creole seasoning to taste, and garlic in large bowl. Stir in cabbage mixture and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Serve. (Coleslaw can be refrigerated in airtight container for 2 days.)
