### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 7 large carrots, peeled and grated  
* 1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped  
* Juice of two lemons  
* 2-3 tbsp olive oil  
* A pinch of sugar  
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
* A dab of Dijon mustard  

</div>

### Instructions
Mix the lemon juice, olive oil, sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and the dijon (optional) and whisk to combine. Pour over the carrots and toss to dress completely. Taste and correct seasoning if needed.  

The salad can be held for a bit, but will taste and look best if served soon after it's made.
