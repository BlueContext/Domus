Sometimes, when you do the final mix you may find you want a couple more tablespoons of mayonnaise — simply add a tablespoon at a time until you have a consistency you like.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

5 lbs russet potatoes (about 9 medium), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes.  
1/4 cup white wine vinegar  
2 cups mayonnaise  
2 medium ribs celery, chopped fine  
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced (optional)  
1/2 cup sweet pickle relish  
1/3 cup minced red onion, soaked in cold water for 5 minutes and drained  
2 scallions, minced very finely  
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley  
1 1/2 tsp celery seed  
1 tsp powdered mustard  
2 tbsp Dijon mustard  
Tabasco sauce  
4 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and cut into a 1/4-inch dice  
Salt and black pepper

### Instructions

Place the potatoes in a large Dutch oven and cover by 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender (a paring knife can be slipped into and out of the center of the potatoes with very little resistance), about 8 minutes.

Drain the potatoes in a colander and transfer them to large bowl. Gently stir in the vinegar and let stand until the potatoes are just warm, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir together 1 cup of the mayonnaise with the celery, jalapeño, pickle relish, onion, scallion, parsley, celery seed, dry mustard, Dijon mustard, dashes of Tabasco sauce to taste, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.

Using rubber spatula, gently fold the mayonnaise mixture and eggs (if using) into the potatoes.

#### To Store 
Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

#### To Serve 
Let the salad stand at room temperature about 1 hour. Gently fold in the remaining 1 cup mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper to taste.

#### To Serve Right Away 
Stir all of the mayonnaise into the potatoes in step 4, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
