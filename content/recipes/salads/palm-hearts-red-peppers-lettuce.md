### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 small clove garlic  
1 can whole palm hearts  
1 red bell pepper  
1/3 cup very thinly sliced red onion  
1 head green Boston lettuce, thoroughly washed and dried  
1 recipe Basic Vinaigrette  

</div>

### Instructions
Soak the sliced red onion in a small bowl of ice water until ready to use (this removes some of the onion’s harsh pungency, and keeps them crisp).

Cut the clove of garlic in half and rub the cut side all over in the inside of your salad bowl. If you like, use the remaining garlic in your vinaigrette.  Place the vinaigrette into the bowl.

Rinse and drain the palm hearts. Slice them into ½” – 1/3” slices and place them in the bowl with the vinaigrette.

Julienne the red bell pepper (cut it into matchstick-sized pieces) and add it to the palm hearts.

Drain the sliced red onion thoroughly and add it to the palm hearts.

Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces until you have the desired quantity.  Just before serving, add the lettuce to the bowl and toss everything thoroughly.  Season with fresh ground black pepper to taste.

Variation: for a more formal composed salad, keep the lettuce leaves whole and serve the palm hearts mixture on a bed of attractively arranged lettuce leaves.
