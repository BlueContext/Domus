### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/4 cup olive oil  
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice  
1 medium orange, peeled and cut into supremes  

</div>

### Instructions
Cook the asparagus in boiling water until barely tender. Plunge into a bowl of ice water to stop cooking and ensure a bright color.

In a mixing bowl, whisk the oil and orange juice with salt and pepper to taste, combining to make a vinaigrette. 

Divide the asparagus among 4 plates, and place 2 orange segments across each pile of asparagus. Spoon the dressing over the salad and serve.
