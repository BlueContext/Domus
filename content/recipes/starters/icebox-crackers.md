### Parmesan Rosemary Crackers

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 1/2 c. Flour  
1 tsp. Salt  
A pinch of white pepper  
A pinch of cayenne pepper  
1 heaping tablespoon of very finely minced fresh rosemary  
6 tbsp. Butter, chilled and cut into small pieces  
2 c. (5 oz.) finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for topping  
1/2 c. + 2 tbsp sour cream   

</div>

To the work bowl of a food processor, add the flour, salt, pepper, cayenne and rosemary. Pulse to combine.  Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the cheese and pulse to combine. Add 1 tbsp of sour cream at a time, pulsing each time to combine. Process until the dough comes together and is well-combined.

Transfer the dough to a board. Shape it into a 2-inch diameter log. Wrap it tightly in waxed paper and chill for 24 hours. The dough can be wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen at this point.  Thaw in the refrigerator before using.

Preheat the oven to 325 F. Slice the chilled log into 1/4-inch slices and lay the slices on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle each slice with a pinch of grated Parmesan. Bake, rotating the sheet halfway through cooking, until the slices are golden and firm in the center (about 30 minutes). Transfer to a rack to cool. 

These can be made the day before and stored, after cooling, in an airtight container.
