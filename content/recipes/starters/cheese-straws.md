summary: An old southern classic for a reason – these are just plain good. The dough freezes beautifully when wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

½ lb. sharp cheddar (or other hard cheese), grated and  room temperature  
1 stick butter, room temperature   
1 scant tsp. salt  
1 tsp. dry mustard  
¼ tsp. cayenne pepper  
1 ½ c. flour  
2 tbsp. cold water   

</div>

### Instructions

Sift the flour, salt, mustard and cayenne into a medium bowl.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cheese and butter on low speed, and then on medium, until well-combined. Gradually add in the flour mixture until completely incorporated. Add the water and beat for 1 minute.

Form the dough into a log 2 inches in diameter, wrap tightly in waxed paper and chill thoroughly.

At this point, the dough can be frozen.  

If you’re ready to make cheese straws, roll the dough into a rectangle that is 1/8” thick. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into strips ¼” – 1/3” wide by 8” long, dipping the knife in flour occasionally to facilitate clean cuts.  Carefully transfer the strips to a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving ¼” space between them.  If the tough dough becomes too soft while you’re working with it, refrigerate it for 15 minutes and then start again.

Bake them at 350 F until the ends just start to brown (12 – 15 minutes). Let the straws cool to room temperature on the baking sheet before serving (they’re too fragile until they’re cool).

A quicker method is to make cheese wafers – just cut ¼” slices off the log of dough and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake as above.
