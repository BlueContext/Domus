If you don’t want to mess with a grill, this can be done in a very hot (475-500) oven. It will lack the smoky notes, of course, but it will still be very good.

Finally, the any mixture of mushrooms that you like will work well here. White button mushrooms would be boring, but shiitakes and portabellos are both widely available and won’t break the bank.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/4 lb. Oyster mushrooms, torn into clumps  
1/4 lb. Shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced  
1/4 lb. Portobello mushrooms, stemmed and very coarsely chopped bite-size  
1/4 lb. Chanterelle mushrooms  
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced  
2-3 cloves garlic, finely minced  
2 tbsp. Olive oil  
1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary  
2 tsp chopped fresh sage  
2 tsp chopped fresh parsley  
1 tsp chopped fresh thyme  
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar  
1/2 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth  
8 slices of crusty bread, toasted on the grill

### Instructions
Combine everything except the wine and bread in a bowl, along with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste, and toss gently with your hands to combine. Set aside. 

Place a fajita sizzle pan or cast iron skillet on a hot grill, cover, and heat until the pan is very hot.  Empty the mushroom mixture into the hot pan and close the grill cover. Cook until the mushroom are tender, about 5 more minutes. Remove from grill and pour in the white wine to sizzle.  Serve in the hot pan with the toasted bread.
