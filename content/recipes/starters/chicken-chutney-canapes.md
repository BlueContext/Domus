### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/4 cup drained chutney (Major Greyâ€™s), minced  
1 stick (1/2 c) butter, softened  
3 tbsp minced scallions  
1 tbsp Dijon mustard

### Instructions

In a bowl, combine the chutney, the butter, the scallions, the mustard, and salt and pepper to taste, until the mixture is smooth. Spread the bread with three-fourths of the chutney mixture and cut each slice into quarters.

Trim the chicken into squares to fit the bread and top the bread with it.  Put a dot of the remaining chutney mixture on each canape, and affix a coriander leaf and a grape half to the chutney mixture on each canape.
