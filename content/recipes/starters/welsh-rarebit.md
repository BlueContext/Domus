### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

8oz sharp cheddar, shredded  
2 tbsp all-purpose flour  
2 tbsp salted butter  
½ tsp. Black pepper  
¼ tsp. Cayenne

### Instructions
In a bowl, toss the cheese with 1 teaspoon flour. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the remaining flour, black pepper and cayenne. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. 

Stir in the mustard and Worcestershire, then slowly stir in the beer. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-low, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 3 minutes.

Reduce heat to low and add the cheese a handful at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition.

Off heat, season with salt and pepper. To serve, spoon the sauce over toast and sprinkle with the chives.
