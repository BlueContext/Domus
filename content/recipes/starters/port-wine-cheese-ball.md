Be sure to let it come to room temperature — the cream cheese means that this dip is quite stiff when cold.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/2 lb sharp Cheddar cheese, finely grated  
8 oz cream cheese  
1/4 cup Port wine  
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce  
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper  
1/2 tsp seasoned salt (I use Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning)  
1 cup sliced almonds  

</div>

### Instructions
Place everything but the almonds in the work bowl of a food processor. Blitz until completely smooth and blended. Use a spatula to scrape the mixture into an airtight container and refrigerate until the mixture is firm, at least 2 hours.

Scoop the cheese mixture out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form it into a nicely shaped ball. Wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Toast the almond slices in a small saucepan over medium heat for about 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and beginning to brown. Spread them out on a large plate or small rimmed baking sheet, and roll the cheese ball over them until it’s evenly covered.  

Serve with crackers.
