The seasoning and herbs can be varied, and a wide variety of dry hard cheese can be substituted, but it must be said that there is nothing quite like the nutty savoriness of real imported Parmesan cheese.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 1/4 cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano  
* 2 teaspoons flour  
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves  
* Black pepper to taste  

</div>

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 F.  Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.  Using a 2 3/4‚Äù cutter as a guide, outline circles on the paper with a graphite pencil.  Turn the parchment pencil-side down.

Combine the cheese, flour and cayenne thoroughly. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the mixture in each circle, spreading the mixture evenly.  Sprinkle a few thyme leaves and a grind of black pepper over each circle.

Bake in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they are firm and lightly golden. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before transferring to paper towels to blot off any oil.
