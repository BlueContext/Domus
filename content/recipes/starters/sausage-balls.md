## Introduction
These aren’t winning any awards for elegance or culinary sophistication, but they’re rich, spicy and just plain good. It’s one of those hokey old recipes that’s been around forever…and there’s a reason for that!

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lb. sharp cheddar cheese, grated, at room temperature  
1 lb. raw hot bulk sausage (Jimmy Dean is best)  
3 c. Bisquick baking mix  
3 tbsp. butter, melted  
½ tsp. cayenne pepper   

</div>

## Instructions

Let all ingredients come to room temperature for 30 minutes.  

Sift the Bisquick and cayenne pepper together into a large bowl.  Mix in the melted butter until the Bisquick has a crumbly sand texture.  Add all of the other ingredients and mix thorough by hand (it’s gross, but my source assures me it’s the only way). 

Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 F. 

Roll the mixture into 1 inch balls and bake them on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 10-12 minutes (they should be slightly browned).  

Serve warm.
