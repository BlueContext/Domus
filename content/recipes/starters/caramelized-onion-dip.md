Be sure to let it come to room temperature — the cream cheese means that this dip is quite stiff when cold.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
3 medium onions, halved and thinly sliced  
1 1/2 cups sour cream, at room temperature  
1/2 pound cream cheese, softened  
1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley  
1/2 teaspoon onion powder  
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper  
Potato chips, for serving

### Instructions

In a large skillet, melt the butter. Add the onions and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 25 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of water and cook, stirring, until the water has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Let the onions cool slightly, about 15 minutes.   

Transfer the onions to a cutting board and coarsely chop. In a large bowl, mix the sour cream with the cream cheese, parsley, onion powder and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Stir in the onions and season with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature. 

The onion dip can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.
