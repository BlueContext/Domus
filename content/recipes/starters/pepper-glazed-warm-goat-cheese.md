If you can find a good pepper jelly, that can stand in for the apricot preserves and minced peppers.

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 lb. creamy fresh goat cheese (chèvre) softened to room temperature  
* 6 tbsp. apricot preserves  
* 4 Peppadew peppers, finely chopped  
* 1 pickled jalapeño, seeded and finely minced

</div>

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400°. Spread the goat cheese in a 5-by-8-inch gratin dish in an even layer. In a small bowl, whisk the preserves with the Peppadews, jalapeño, onions, mustard and sherry. Spread the mixture over the goat cheese and bake on the top rack of the oven for about 5 minutes, until warm. Turn on the broiler and broil for about 2 minutes, until the topping is bubbling and lightly browned at the edges. Serve hot, with pita chips and toasted baguette slices.
