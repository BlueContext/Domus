I don’t find Robiola often, but while it’s wonderful if you can find it, the suggested substitutes work beautifully.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

3 hot or sweet Italian sausages, casings removed  
5 ounces stracchino cheese such as Robiola (or grated Fontina or mozzarella)  
1 tbsp. fennel seeds  
6 slices of country style bread, cut in half     

</div>

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Crumble the raw sausage into a bowl. Stir in the cheese and fennel seeds, mixing thoroughly.  Season with salt and pepper (not too much salt – the sausage and the cheese are already well-salted). This mixture can be prepared well in advance; just cover and keep refrigerated until you’re ready to use it.

Spread the mixture on the bread slices and place them on a cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes. Arrange on a platter and serve immediately.
