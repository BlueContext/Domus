You can buy char siu (Chinese BBQ pork) at many chinese markets and restaurants, but it’s well worth making your own. These freeze beautifully before cooking, or after cooking (but leave them slightly undercooked, and drain well -- in this case, they can be warmed in a moderate oven).

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

8 cups shredded savoy cabbage  
8 cups shredded green cabbage  
2 cups shredded carrot  
2 cups shredded celery  
3 scallions, chopped  
2 1/2 tsp salt  
2 tsp sugar  
1 tbsp sesame oil  
2 tbsp peanut oil, plus enough for deep-frying the egg rolls  
1/4 tsp five-spice powder  
1/4 tsp white pepper  
3 cups diced char siu (Chinese BBQ pork)  
2 cups cooked and chopped shrimp (optional)  
1 package egg roll wrappers (about 24)  
1 egg, beaten

### Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the cabbage, carrots, and celery into the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes. Transfer to an ice bath and drain. Thoroughly squeeze out all the excess water from the vegetables (you can put the drained vegetables in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out the water). This is a very important step — a wet filling will yield soggy, sodden egg rolls.

Once dry, transfer the vegetables to a large mixing bowl. Add the scallions, salt, sugar, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons oil, five spice powder (if using), white pepper, roast pork, and cooked shrimp (if using). Toss everything together to thoroughly combine.

To wrap the egg rolls, take a small fistful of filling, squeeze it a little in your hand until it is compressed together, and place it on the wrapper. The wrapping method is similar to that of a burrito. Just add a thin layer of egg to make sure it stays sealed. Line them up on a lightly floured surface, and continue assembling until you run out of ingredients.

In a pot, heat oil to 325 degrees. You don't need too much—just enough to submerge the egg rolls. Carefully place a couple egg rolls into the oil, and fry them for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil to make sure they fry evenly.

Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, and serve.

Cooks note: Allow the cooked egg rolls to cool completely, and then freeze them. Store the frozen rolls in a resealable plastic bag. They can be reheated in a 350 degree oven, just until crispy.
