### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

A 2 or 2.5 lb rack of baby back pork ribs (ask your butcher to saw it in half lengthwise)  
2 to 3 cups peanut oil or olive oil  
3/4 cup honey  
1/3 cup grainy mustard  
1 1/2 cup dry sherry   

</div>

### Instructions
Cut the rack between the ribs into individual ribs. Put the ribs in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven and add enough oil to cover them.

Heat the oil to 250F on a deep-fry thermometer. Cook the ribs for about 2 hours, until they can be pierced easily with a skewer.

Remove from the heat and let the ribs cool in the oil. Proceed with the recipe now, or refrigerate the ribs in the oil for up to a week.

Remove the ribs from the oil and transfer them to paper towels to drain.

In a medium saucepan, bring the honey and mustard to a boil over medium high heat. Stir in the sherry, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the liquid is reduced and syrupy.

In a large skillet, quickly sear the ribs over medium high ehat until they are browned and crisp on all sides; remove from heat.

Baste the ribs all over with the glaze.  Arrange the ribs onto a serving platter and serve at once.
