<div class="ingredient-list">

1 1/4 lbs smoked salmon  
3 sticks (1 1/2 c) softened butter

## Instructions

In a food processor fitted with the standard blade, blend the salmon in  2 batches with the butter, lemon juice and cream until the mixture is smooth, transferring it to a bowl when blended.  Stir in the cayenne and drops of Tabasco sauce.  Taste and add lemon juice or Tabasco to correct seasoning.

Line a pate mold or loaf pan with plastic wrap, spread the salmon mixture in the mold. Cover tightly with plastic and chill for at least 8 hours. Dip the mold into hot water, invert a platter over it, and invert the pate onto the platter. Unmold and remove the plastic wrap. 

Cut the pate into 1/2-inch slices. Serve the pate with toast points or crackers.
