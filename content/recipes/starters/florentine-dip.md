## Introduction

This is my version of a 1959 recipe from Craig Claiborne of the New York Times, which has stood the test of time. It’s simply good, it comes together it about 10 minutes, and it can be made well in advance. Serve with crunchy kettle-style potato chips or — for an occasion -- a colorful selection of raw vegetables for dipping.

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

3 oz cream cheese, at room temperature  
2 tsp mashed or finely chopped anchovies  
1 cup sour cream  
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley  
3 tbsp chopped chives or scallions  
2 tsp chopped capers  
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
1/2 of a large garlic clove, minced  
Salt and black pepper to taste  
Sliced vegetables or sturdy potato chips (or both) for serving  

</div>

## Instructions

Place the cream cheese and anchovy in a medium bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the remaining ingredients and mix until well-combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I also like a few dashes of Tabasco Sauce). Cover and refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors come together.

Spoon the dip into a serving bowl and serve with sliced vegetables and/or potato chips.
