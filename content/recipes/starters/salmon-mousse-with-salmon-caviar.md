### Instructions

Put the fresh salmon fillet in a buttered small heavy casserole just large enough to hold it, season with salt and pepper, top with 2 lemon slices and 4 tbsp butter (in 1 tbsp pats), and sprinkle the vermouth over the salmon. Cover the salmon and bake it in the middle of a preheated 350 F oven for 12-15 min, or until it just barely flakes when tested with a fork.

Let the salmon cool in the covered casserole for 20 minutes.  Remove and discard the skin and any bones. Flake the salmon and place the meat and accumulated juices in a bowl; set aside.

Line the bottom of an oiled 5-cup charlotte mold or soufflé dish with a round of wax paper, oil the paper, and press the coriander leaves face down onto the paper decoratively. 

In a small metal bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and lemon juice and let it soften for 5 min. Add the boiling water and stir the mixture until the gelatin is dissolved. 

In a food processor blend together the smoked salmon, the cooked salmon flakes and juices, the sour cream, and the Tabasco until the mixture is smooth. With the motor running, add the gelatin mixture, scrape down the sides, and then add the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste. Process the mixture until it is smooth and well-combined. In a large bowl beat the heavy cream until it holds soft peaks, add it to the salmon mixture, and pulse the motor until the mousse is just combined. Pour the mousse into the prepared mold and chill it, covered, for at least 8 hours (preferably overnight).

Dip the mold into a large pan of hot water for 10 seconds and run a thin knife around the edge. Invert a platter over the mold and invert the mousse onto the platter. If it doesn’t want to unmold, give it another dip in the hot water and try again. You can jiggle it gently, but don’t shake it. If the coriander leaves stick to the wax paper, replace them on top of the mousse. Spoon the salmon roe around the top edge of the mousse, garnish the platter with the celery leaves and/or Belgian endive, and serve the mousse with the crudités, crackers, or toast points.
