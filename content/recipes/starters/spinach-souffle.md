### Instructions
In a large saucepan, cook the spinach, covered, in the water clinging to the leaves over high heat for 5 minutes, or until it is wilted. Drain the spinach well, squeezing out excess moisture, chop it finely, and squeeze it out again until thoroughly dry. You should have about 1 cup.

Preheat the oven to 350.

Butter a 1 1/4 quart souffle dish and coat the inside with some grated Parmesan, tapping out the excess (this will help the souffle mixture climb the sides of the dish).  Sit the dish in a cake pan.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat until the foam subsides, add the flour and 1/4 tsp salt, and cook the roux over moderately low heat, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the milk, and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove the pan from heat, stir in the onion, the Gruyere, the nutmeg, a few drops of Tabasco, the cayenne, and the remaining 1 tsp salt. Stir in the egg yolks and the spinach, combining thoroughly.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the Cream of Tartar and a pinch of salt until they hold stiff peaks.  Stir 1/4 of the whites into the spinach mixture to loosen it, and then fold the remaining whites in carefully but thoroughly.

Transfer the mixture to the buttered souffle dish.  Fill the cake pan with 1” of hot water. Bake the souffle in the preheated oven for 45-55 minutes, or until it is puffed and lightly browned.
