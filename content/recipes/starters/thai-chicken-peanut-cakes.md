### Instructions

Mix the sugar into the fish sauce and place in a bowl with the chicken, peanuts, breadcrumbs, curry paste, lime juice, kaffir lime leaves, sweet chili sauce and cilantro. Mix until thoroughly combined.

Divide the mixture into 24 small balls. Flatten the balls into disks about 1/2” thick. Lay them in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.

Heat the oil in a heavy-bottom frying pan and cook the cakes in batches for 2-3 minutes on each side or until firm and golden. Drain on paper towels.

Top each cake with a dab of sweet chili sauce, insert a toothpick into each one, and serve warm.
Cooks note: the uncooked patties can be frozen for up to 2 months.
