You’ll need a new cutter to shape these correctly — it needs to be nice and flat. Sharp scissors are good for trimming up any untidy bits.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 stick (1/2 c) + 1/4 stick butter, softened  
1 tsp lemon juice  
1 tbsp shallot  
1/2 c packed parsley leaves  
1/2 lb thinly sliced prosciutto  
16 sliced very thin bread  

</div>

### Instructions

In a food processor, blend 1 stick of the butter, lemon juice, shallot, parsley, salt, pepper and drops of Tabasco to taste, until the mixture is very smooth. Transfer the butter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4” star tip. 

Use a 2-inch round cutter to cut 16 circles from the bread slices, spread them with a very thin smear of the remaining butter, and season them very lightly with salt and pepper.

Use the same cutter to cut circles of prosciutto and place them on the buttered bread circles.

Pipe a wreath of parsley butter on the rim of each circle. Chill the “wreaths”, covered loosely, for 30 minutes or until the butter is firm.

These may be made 6 hours in advance and held covered loosely and chilled.
