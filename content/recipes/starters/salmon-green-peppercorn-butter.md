## Instructions

Put the salmon in a buttered small heavy casserole just large enough to hold it and top with fennel seeds, the anchovy, the tomato paste, 2 tsp of the peppercorns, the lemon zest, the Pernod, and the salt. Cover the salmon with 4 tbsp of the butter, sliced thin, and bake it, covered, in the middle of a preheated 350 F oven for 12-15 min, or until it just barely flakes when tested with a fork.

Let the salmon cool in the covered casserole for 20 minutes.  Remove and discard the skin and any bones.

Place salmon mixture and pan juices in the work bowl of food processor and pulse until coarsely ground. Add the remaining 6 tbsp butter, 1 tsp of the remaining peppercorns, the lemon juice and salt to taste, and blend well (but do not totally puree).

Transfer the salmon butter to a serving dish, packing it and smoothing the top. Mark the top decoratively with the tines of a fork if desired. Chill, covered tightly with plastic wrap, at least 1 hour and up to 48 hours.

Let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. Just before serving, garnish with the lemon slice, the fennel fronds, and the additional peppercorns if desired. Serve with fennel crudite and crackers.
