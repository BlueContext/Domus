serves: "Makes 2 1/2 cups"
summary: "There are many variations on this sort of thing, but I like this one particularly -- the fresh tarragon saves this hot dip from drownding in its own richness."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/2 cup butter  
2 cloves garlic, crushed  
3 shallots, thinly sliced  
1 tsp mustard powder  
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper  
1/2 c whipping cream  
2/3 c cream cheese  
1/2 c grated white cheddar  
11 oz can jumbo lump crabmeat, drained  
2 tbsp lemon juice  
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce  
3 tsp finely chopped fresh tarragon  
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs (easily made by tossing a couple of slices of white bread into the food processor and pulsing until finely ground)  
1 tbsp finely minced fresh parsley

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 325 F.

Melt half of the butter in a saucepan and cook the garlic and shallots for 2-3 minutes or until softened. Add the mustard powder, cayenne and whipping cream. Bring to a simmer and slowly whisk in the cream cheese a bit at a time. When the cream cheese is fully incorporated, whisk in the cheddar and allow to cook, stirring constantly, over very low heat for 1-2 minutes or until smooth. 

Remove from the heat and add the crabmeat, lemon juice, Worcestershire and 2 tsp of the tarragon. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly and transfer to a small baking dish.

Melt the remaining butter in a small pan, add the breadcrumbs, parsley and remaining tarragon, and stir just until combined. Sprinkle the buttered crumbs over the crab mixture and bake for 15 minutes or until golden. Serve warm with crackers or toast triangles.
