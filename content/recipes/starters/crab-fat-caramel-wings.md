title: Crab Fat Caramel Wings
serves: Serves 4
summary: "These wings, a famous creation of San Antonio chef Quealy Watson that was featured in Bon Appetit magazine in September 2014, are as good-tasting as they are weird-sounding. Enjoying them in their native setting — with a craft cocktail at Hot Joy in Southtown — is perhaps ideal, but they’re easy enough to make at home. "

You might have a hard time shopping for the “magic” ingredient, but it’s easy to get online. One word of warning: when you make this sauce, it will smell terrible and you’ll wonder what the hell you’re doing. I promise, the final product is just unbelievably good.

### Instructions

#### Make caramel sauce:

Bring fish sauce to a boil in a medium saucepan and cook until reduced almost by half (it will darken and become pungent), about 5 minutes. Stir in sugar and fit saucepan with thermometer. Cook until thermometer registers 230°F (mixture will become thick and dark). Whisk in crab paste and 1 tablespoons water until smooth. Reduce heat to low; keep warm until ready to dip wings. 

#### Fry wings:

Fit a large pot with clean thermometer and pour in oil to measure 2". Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350°F. 

Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, and 1 cup cornstarch in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually add vodka and 1 3/4 cups water, adding more water if batter is too thick (it should be slightly thinner than cream but thicker than milk). 

Place remaining 1/2 cup cornstarch in a shallow dish. Season chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in cornstarch, shaking off excess. 

Working in 3 batches and returning oil to 350°F between batches, coat chicken in batter, letting excess drip back into bowl, and fry until skin is golden and chicken is crisp and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet to drain. 

#### To serve:
Using tongs, add hot wings to warm caramel, turn to coat, then transfer wings to a platter. Serve wings topped with peanuts and cilantro. 

#### Cooks' note:
Caramel sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Keep airtight at room temperature. Reheat before using.
