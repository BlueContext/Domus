*Serves 6*

## Introduction

In most restaurants, this would be called Crab Ravigote, but Galatoire's of New Orleans (long accustomed to doing things their own way) already has another recipe called by that name. In any case, it's wonderful.

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

*For the Maison dressing:*  
1/2 cup white wine vinegar  
2 tablespoons Creole mustard (you may substitute Dijon, or a course, seeded country-style mustard)  
1-1/2 cups high quality olive oil  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper  

*For the rest:*  
1/2 cup real mayonnaise  
3 tablespoons Maison dressing  
3 green onions, finely chopped  
1 teaspoon small capers, rinsed and drained  
1/2 teaspoon chopped flat-leaf parsley  
1 pound lump crabmeat  
12 large leaves butter lettuce  
12 slices tomato  
Lemons

## Instructions

To make the Maison dressing, combine vinegar and mustard. Slowly whisk in olive oil, a little at a time, to form an emulsion. Season with salt and pepper.

Mix together mayonnaise, Maison dressing, green onions, capers and parsley. Gently fold in the crabmeat, making sure not to break up the lumps.

Divide into six equal portions and serve on a bed of butter lettuce, with two slices of tomato and a squeeze from a wedge of lemon just before serving.
