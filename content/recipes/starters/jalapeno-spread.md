*Makes enough for a party.*

## Introduction

If you don’t have a food grinder, finely mince the jalapeños, onion, and garlic in a food processor, shred the cheese, and mix everything for 5 minutes or so in a stand mixer.  A combination of red and green jalapeños makes a nice-looking spread for a Christmas party.
