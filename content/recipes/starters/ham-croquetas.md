### Instructions
In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the flour and stir for 2-3 minutes until smooth and bubbling. Gradually whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. When mixture is thickened, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. The sauce should be thick and not having any pasty, raw-flour taste.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

Add the ham and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Transfer the stiff bechamel to a bowl and set aside to cool. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap, pressing it onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.

Preheat the oven to 200F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Pour the bread crumbs into a shallow bowl.  In a small bowl, beat the egg and water.

In a saute pan, heat 1 inch of oil over medium high heat until shimmering. With floured hands, roll spoonfulls of the becheamel mixture into 1 inch balls. Arrange the balls on a flour-covered place such that they’re not touching each other.

Briefly dip each one in the beaten egg, and then roll them in the crumbs to coat thoroughly and evenly. Carefully add 4 or 5 croquetas to the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until golden on the bottom.  Turn them very carefully and fry until golden all over.

Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove them to the prepared baking sheet. Keep them warm in the oven while the rest are fried.

Serve hot.
