You could omit the brown sugar and tuck a couple of needles of rosemary under each bacon “belt” if you feel the need to class it up, but the sweet-and-salty flavor profile of the original really is best.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 12 slices bacon (important: not thick cut)  
* 48 Club crackers or saltines  
* 6 tablespoon dark brown sugar  
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  

</div>

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 250° F. Line a broiler pan or rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. Place a rack over the pan.

Mix the sugar and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.

Cut the bacon slices in half lengthwise and then crosswire to create 4 long strips.

Arrange the crackers on a work surface and wrap a bacon strip around each cracker, overlapping the ends on top.  Carefully sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon brown sugar on the top side of each cracker, pressing to help it adhere (avoid getting sugar on the cracker or it will burn.)

Arrange the crackers seam-side down 1/2 apart in a single layer on the rack, and bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the bacon is at your desired level of crispness. Transfer the crackers to a cooling rack and cool completely before serving.
