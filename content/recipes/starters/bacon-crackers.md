## Introduction

These easy little bites have been popular across the south since the 1950’s. They’re not exactly fancy, but they’re addictively good.  You could omit the brown sugar and tuck a couple of needles of rosemary under each bacon “belt” if you feel the need to class it up, but the sweet-and-salty flavor profile of the original really is best.

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

12 slices bacon (very important: NOT thick cut)
48 Club crackers or saltines
6 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

</div>

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 250° F. Line a broiler pan or rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. Place a rack over the pan.

Cut the bacon slices in half lengthwise and then crosswire to create 4 long strips.

Arrange the crackers on a work surface and wrap a bacon strip around each cracker, overlapping the ends on top.  Carefully sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon brown sugar on the top side of each cracker, pressing to help it adhere (avoid getting sugar on the cracker or it will burn.)

Arrange the crackers seam-side down 1/2 apart in a single layer on the rack, and bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the bacon is at your desired level of crispness. Transfer the crackers to a cooling rack and cool completely before serving.
