*Makes 4-5 dozen puffs*

## Introduction

These delicious, unassuming little puffs of cheese pastry are absolutely perfect with drinks before dinner with a small group of friends. The batter can be prepared a bit in advance, but the puffs must be baked shortly before serving. The cheese is essentially the only flavoring here, so use the best quality — imported Swiss Gruyere and Italian Parmigiano Reggiano.

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 recipe savory [Pate a Choux]({{< ref "/recipes/basic-doughs-and-batters/pate-a-choux.md" >}} "Pâte à Choux, Savory & Sweet"), about 2 cups, still warm  
Cayenne pepper  
5 oz. Shredded Gruyere cheese  
1/3 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Mix the cayenne and Gruyere thoroughly into the warm choux paste. 

Transfer the batter to a large plastic freezer-bag. Snip 3/4” off of one corner.  Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in scant 1 tbsp balls one inch apart. Sprinkle the Parmigiano on top of each ball.

Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350F and bake for another 15 minutes.  Cool slightly, and then serve immediately. 

NOTE: You can also make larger puffs, piping 2” balls of paste with 2” between them.  In that case, bake for 20 minutes at 425F, and then 15 minutes at 375. At that point, stab each puff in the side with a sharp knife, and then return to the oven (turned off) for 10 minutes with the door ajar.
