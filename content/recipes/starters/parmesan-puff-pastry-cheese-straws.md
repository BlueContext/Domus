*Makes about 2 dozen*

## Introduction

Serve these long and lovely cheese straws upright in a clear glass vase to add an element of dramatic height to an hors d'oeuvres table. These are a bit of a project, but they’re absolutely addictive. Use best-quality Parmigiano Reggiano, as there are few other flavors here and the rich nuttiness of the toasted cheese is a highlight.

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

Flour for work surface  
1 14-oz package all-butter puff pastry (such as Dufour)  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
1 oz Parmesan cheese, grated (or 1/2 cup)  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp poppy seeds  
1/2 tsp cayenne

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

On a lightly floured surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll puff pastry carefully until you have a 12-by-16 inch rectangle.  With the long side facing you, lightly brush the bottom half of the rectangle with some of the beaten egg. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the Parmesan and the salt on the top half of the rectangle. Fold the bottom half up over the top half and roll gently to seal.

Cut the rectangle lengthwise in thirds to produce three 2-by-16 inch strips. Brush lightly with egg, avoiding edges. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on 1 strip, poppy seeds on the second strip, and the cayenne pepper on the third strip. 

Using a sharp knife, carefully cut each strip lengthwise into eight 1/4-by-16 inch strips.

Carefully transfer the strips to the baking sheets, leaving 1 inch of space between them. Working with one strip at a time, hold each end with your fingers and twist in opposite directions to form a spiral twist. Press the ends firmly against the parchment to prevent the strips from un-twisting. This procedure will take a few repetitions to get the hang of, but no matter — the first few straws might not be perfect, but they’ll taste just as good.

Freeze or refrigerator the strips until they’re very firm and cold, about 15 minutes.

Bake 1 sheet at a time, rotating once, for 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the straws a wire rack and allow to cool completely.  

These can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature for up to 2 days.
