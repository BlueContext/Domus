3 oz. Cream cheese (room temperature)

### Instructions

In a bowl, cream together the cream cheese, Roquefort, Cognac and cayenne until it is well-mixed and light. Divide the mixture evenly among the slices of toast, and spread it evenly.

Put the toasts on a small foil-lined pan and place under a preheated broiler for 2 minutes, or until the tops are bubbly and lightly browned.

Cut each toast into 4 triangles and serve immediately.
