Baked in a single dish and served with toasts or crackers, it makes a pleasant appetizer for a party. Baked in individual ramekins, it’s an ideal first course for a dinner party.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lb jumbo lump crab meat, picked over for shell fragments  
4 tbsp butter  
1 tbsp finely minced shallot or scallion  
4 tbsp flour  
1 cup cream  
4 tbsp dry sherry  
Salt, white pepper, and cayenne to taste  
3/4 cup shredded Gruyère or sharp white cheddar  

</div>

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F.

In a saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter until it foams and subsides. Add the shallot or scallion and cook just until softened. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for a minute or so to cook out the raw taste. Stirring constantly, add the cream 1/4 cup at a time to achieve a smooth cream sauce. Add the sherry, return to a simmer, and season to taste with salt, plus a small pinch of white pepper and cayenne.

Remove from heat and fold in the crab meat. Spoon the mixture into a buttered casserole, or 4 individual ramekins. Sprinkle with the grated cheese.

Bake until the mixture is bubbly and the cheese is melted just beginning to brown. Do not overcook. Let rest for a couple of minutes before serving.
