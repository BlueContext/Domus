### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 F. Grease and flour a muffin tin, or line with oiled paper cups.

In a mixing bowl, combine the egg, orange juice, 2 tbsp sugar, vegetable oil and almond extract. Mix thoroughly. Mix in the biscuit mix and pecans.

In a small bowl, combine the butter, flour, 4 tbsp sugar, and nutmeg. Use a fork to cut the mixture together until it resembles crumbs.

Fill each muffin cup 1/3 full with batter.  Place 1 tsp of cherry preserves in the middle of each cup, and top with remaining batter to make the cups 2/3 full. Sprinkle the topping over each muffin, and bake for 25 minutes.
