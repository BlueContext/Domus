### Instructions
#### Make the Compote
Melt the butter in skillet over medium heat. Add the apples, lemon juice, and maple syrup. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples soften and release their juices. Increase heat until the juices are boiling. Stir in the cinnamon and cook until the juices are thickened. Stir in a tiny pinch of salt. Remove from heat and keep warm.

#### Make the Pancakes
In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and the salt.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the pumpkin butter with the buttermilk, sugar, 1 tbsp melted butter, and eggs. Combine the flour mixture with the pumpkin mixture.

Heat a buttered griddle or nonstick pan over medium-low heat. Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake onto the prepared griddle and cook until bubbles appear on the surface and begin to pop.  Flip, cooking 5-8 minutes in total.  Repeat with remaining batter.

Serve with the compote and  garnish with chopped toasted pecans.
