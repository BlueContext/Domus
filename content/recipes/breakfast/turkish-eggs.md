### Instructions

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a simmer over medium heat.

In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, garlic, 1/4 tsp of cumin, and a pinch of salt. Divide between two shallow serving bowls, using the back of a spoon to spread it and create a divot for the eggs to rest in.

In a small saucepan, heat the butter and oil over medium heat. Add the Allepo pepper, the remaining 1/4 tsp cumin, and the coriander, along with a bit of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Wait until it's foamed up and fragrant, about 30 seconds; remove from heat.

Add the vinegar to the simmering water. Control heat so that small bubbles are just rising to the top, but the water is still. Poach the eggs just until the whites are cooked through, 2-3 minutes.  Remove them with a slotted spoon, dabbing them on papper towels to remove excess water. Transfer 2 eggs to each bowl of yogurt.

Season the eggs with salt and pepper, and then drizzle with the spiced butter and sprinkle with dill or parsley.

Serve immediately with bread.
