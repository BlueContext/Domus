This is on the small side; you’ll need a 9” tart tin or an 8” pie plate. 

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 cup cracker crumbs, finely crushed  
* 1/4 cup butter, melted  
* 8 large spears of asparagus, trimmed (optional)  
* 6 sliced of bacon, fried (reserve drippings), drained, and crumbled  
* 1 cup chopped onions  
* 8 ounces shredded swiss cheese, plus an additional 1/2 cup for topping  
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten  
* 3/4 cups sour cream  
* 1/2 tsp salt  
* Black pepper  
* Tabasco sauce  
* Nutmeg

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 375 F. Butter the tart tin or pie plate. Put a small saucepan full of water on to boil.

Cook the chopped onion in the bacon drippings over medium heat until the onion is fully soft and translucent; do not brown them.

If adding the asparagus, cut the spears into 1/2” lengths and blanch them in boiling water for 4 minutes. Drain and plunge into cold water to stop cooking.

Thoroughly combine the cracker crumbs and melted butter. Dump them into the tart tin or pie plate, and press the mixture flat across the bottom and up the sides. This is easy using the bottom of a measuring cup.

In a bowl, thoroughly whisk together the eggs and sour cream with the salt and pepper, a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, and dashes of Tabasco to your own taste. Stir in the sauteed onions and bacon drippings, the swiss cheese, the bacon and the asparagus (if using).

Pour the mixture into the prepared tart tin or pie plate, and sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. If you’re using a tart tin, it will definitely be done at 25 minutes. You’ll need to check more carefully if using an American-style pie plate.

Move to a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.
