The keys to this recipe are the surprising amount of butter in the batter (this is what produces the shatteringly crisp exterior) and the extra step of separating the eggs and whipping the egg whites (this makes the waffles practically weightless).  Finally, a good restaurant-style Belgian waffle iron (the kind that flip over to cook) assures a good outcome every time.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 3/4 c. Flour  
* 1 scant tbsp. Baking powder  
* 1 tbsp. sugar  
* 1/2 tsp. salt  
* 3 eggs, separated  
* 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, melted and cooled to room temperature  
* 1 1/2 c. Whole milk  
* 1 tsp. Vanilla extract  

</div>

### Instructions
In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients and set aside. 

In a large measuring cup or bowl, mix the egg yolks with the milk and vanilla and set aside.

Whip the egg whites with a tiny pinch of salt (using a stand mixer or by hand) until they hold stiff peaks.

Heat your waffle iron.

Heat oven to 200F, and place a rack on a cookie sheet.

Make a well in the dry ingredients, and pour in the milk mixture and the melted butter. Stir to combine with a few strokes of a whisk. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold the egg whites into the batter just until fully combined.

Cook the waffles according to your waffle iron’s instructions. You’ll need to be careful not to overfill the iron until you figure out the right quantity of batter per waffle (this batter, which has a lot of air incorporated,  expands as it cooks).

If you’re not serving the waffles as they come off the iron (which is best), place them on a rack over a cookie sheet and place in the warmed oven to hold for a few minutes.
