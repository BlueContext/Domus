### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 tbsp. packed dark brown sugar  
* ¼ - ½ tsp. cayenne pepper  
* ½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper  
* 1 lb. thick-cut bacon (about 12 slices)  

</div>

### Instructions
Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 F.

In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, cayenne and black pepper.

Arrange the bacon slices in a single layer on a rack in a rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Bake them for 20 minutes.  Turn the slices over and sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly down the length of each slice. Continue baking until the bacon is crisp and brown, 15-20 minutes more. Watch it carefully towards the end, as the sugar can burn very quickly.

Drain on paper towels and serve warm.
