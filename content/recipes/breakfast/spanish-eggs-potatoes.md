### Instructions
Place the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high until tender, about 10 minutes, stirring halfway through. Let cool slightly and, using a potato masher, gently crush them until slightly flattened and cracked but still in large chunks. If the potatoes are too firm to flatten, cover and microwave on high until tender, then crush.

In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high, heat the oil until smoking. Add the chorizo and cook until it is lightly browned and the fat has been rendered out.  Add the onion, garlic and chilies and cook until they are soft and the onions are translucent. Remove everything to a bowl, leaving as much fat as possible behind.

To the fat remaining in the pan add a splash of olive oil if needed. Heat until just smoking and add the potatoes in an even layer. Cook without stirring until crisp on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Stir, redistribute in an even layer and cook until crisp on the bottom, another 5 minutes. Stir in the chorizo onion mixture, the vinegar and Â½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, for about 6 minutes. Distribute the mixture in an even layer and reduce to medium-low.

Using the back of a large spoon, make 6 evenly spaced indentations in the potatoes, each about 2 inches in diameter. Crack 1 egg into each, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 4 to 6 minutes.

Sprinkle the scallion over the top. Using a paring knife, cut a small X in the top of each egg and allow the yolk to flow out.
