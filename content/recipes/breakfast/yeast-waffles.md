summary: "This wonderful recipe from King Arthur Flour produces light, crisp, fluffy waffles with a depth of flavor you can only get from a yeast dough. Best of all (especially for entertaining), the batter is best made the night before."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm/room-temperature milk  
* 6 tbsp butter, melted and cooled  
* 1 tbsp sugar  
* 3/4 tsp salt  
* 1 tsp vanilla  
* 2 large eggs  
* 2 cups flour  
* 1 1/2 tsp instant yeast   

</div>

### Instructions
Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, leaving room for expansion; the mixture will bubble and grow.   

Stir to combine; it's fine if the mixture isn't perfectly smooth. 

Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour; the mixture will begin to bubble. You can cook the waffles at this point, or refrigerate the batter overnight to cook waffles the next day. 

Preheat your waffle iron. Spray with non-stick vegetable oil spray, and pour 2/3 to 3/4 cup batter (or the amount recommended by the manufacturer) onto the center of the iron. Close the lid and bake for the recommended amount of time, until the waffle is golden brown. It takes us 5 to 6 minutes, using a Belgian-style (deep-pocket) waffle iron.
