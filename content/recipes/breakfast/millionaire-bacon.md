### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/4 cup packed brown sugar  
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper  
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper  
1/4 tsp ground ginger  
1 lb thick-cut bacon (10-12 slices)  

</div>

### Instructions
Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Place the brown sugar and spices in large bowl and stir to combine. Add the bacon and toss until the slices are well-coated with the sugar mixture. Arrange the slices on the baking sheet in a single layer, making sure they don’t touch or overlap. Sprinkle any remaining sugar over the top of the bacon.

Bake for 15 minutes. Flip the slices and bake until the bacon is chewy, deeply caramelized, and the fat is rendered (about 15 minutes more).

Remove from the oven and set aside for a minute or two to let the sugar set. It’s molten hot, so don’t touch! Use tongs to transfer the slices to a clean sheet of foil and let it cool for 5 minutes before serving.
