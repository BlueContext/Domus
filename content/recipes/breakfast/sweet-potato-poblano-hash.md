### Instructions
#### Make the Hash
Prepare a large bowl of ice water. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add both kinds of potatoes and cook until tender but still firm at the center, about 3 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to the ice water to halt cooking. Drain well and set aside.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and onions and cook until the onions soften. Add the garlic, red pepper and poblanos and continue cooking until the peppers are beginning to soften. Add the potatoes, stir to combine, and sprinkle the cumin, coriander and oregano over everything. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and continue cooking until the potatoes begin to brown.

Mix in the cilantro and lime juice, correct seasoning, and keep warm.

#### Make the Crema
In a small bowl, mix the crema, cumin and lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Thin as needed with additional lime juice. Set aside.

#### Make the Poached Eggs
Fill a wide, shallow pan with water to a depth of 1 1/2 inches. Add the vinegar and heat over medium heat until it just begins to simmer.  Manage the heat such that the water remains at a bare simmer — bubbles occasionally floating up from the bottom, no more.

Unless your eggs are very, very fresh, you’ll get neater poached eggs if you strain the loose liquid off the egg whites.  To do this, crack one egg at a time into a small mesh strainer, allowing the liquid to drain off.  Then tip the egg into a small bowl.

Holding the lip of the egg bowl near the surface of the water, slip the egg into the water. Using a slotted spoon, gently turn the egg to gather the whites onto themselves.  Repeat with the remaining eggs, spacing them evenly.

Poach a bare simmer until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny, about 2-3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, drain the eggs on a paper towel and transfer them to a buttered plate.  Season the eggs with salt and pepper, cover and set aside. 

To serve, divide the hash among 6 plates and top each with a poached egg. Drizzle some of the crema over each plate, and garnish with chopped cilantro.
