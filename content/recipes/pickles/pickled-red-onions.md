### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 1 large red onion, sliced very thinly
* ½ c. sugar
* ½ c. white wine vinegar
* 1 ½ tsp. salt
* ½ tsp. whole black peppercorns
* 1 allspice berry
* ½ cinnamon stick

</div>

### Instructions
Place the onion slices in a glass bowl or jar.

Combine the remaining ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the hot mixture over the onions. Cover and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate overnight. This benefits from being made at least 1 day ahead, and can be kept for up to 3 weeks.
