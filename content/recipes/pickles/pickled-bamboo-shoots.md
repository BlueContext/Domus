### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 1 7oz package boiled bamboo shoot (vacuum-sealed is preferable to canned)
* Kosher salt
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 3/4 cup chicken stock
* La-Yu (Japanese chili oil), to taste

</div>

### Instructions
Rinse off the bamboo shoots and slice into 1/8" bite-sized slices. Spread them out in a single layer on a cutting board. Sprinkle them generously with Kosher salt and gently massage them. Let them sit for 15 minutes.

Rinse the bamboo shoots under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.

Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sesame oil. When just faintly smoking, add the bamboo shoots and stir fry them until coated completely and warmed through. 

Add the sugar and soy sauce, stirring until everything is combined. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil.

Reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer. Continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is almost completely gone. Add 1/2 tsp of La-Yu if desired. Turn off the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. 

Transfer to a jar and refrigerate. They'll keep for a week or so.
