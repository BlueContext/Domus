title:  Golden Cherry Tomato & Ginger Jam
serves: "Makes 1 1/2 pints"
summary: "This is bright and lovely – almost tropical tasting. A beautiful accent on a cheese plate.  If you know anyone who grows tomatoes, home-grown 'Sungold' cherry tomatoes make vastly superior jam that will taste like summer sunshine all year long."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 2 lbs. yellow or orange cherry tomatoes, cut in half (with juice reserved)
* 2 cups sugar
* 4 ounces fresh ginger, peeled and cut into a small dice 
* The grated zest and the juice from 2-3 lemons (depending on size; the lemons should add up to 8 ounces)

### Instructions
Combine the cut tomatoes with the sugar and stir until the sugar begins to liquefy.  Cover and refrigerate overnight, stirring occasionally.  The sugar should be mostly dissolved.

Stir the tomatoes thoroughly, and the strain the tomato syrup into a large saucepan. Add the ginger, lemon zest and lemon juice. Attach a candy thermometer to the pan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the syrup thickens a bit, and then add the tomatoes. Boil continuously, stirring frequently and skimming off any foam, until the temperature is 218-220, but if the mixture is thick or begins to darken remove it from the heat immediately. If overcooked, the resulting jam will be too firm for use.

Ladle into hot ½ pint jars, leaving ¼” headspace. Process for 10 minutes using the water-bath method. The jam will also keep in the refrigerator for some time without any canning.
