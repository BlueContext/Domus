### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 2 1/2 cups boiling water
* 2 cups (2.5 ounces) dried shiitake mushrooms
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup Chinese black vinegar
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 inch piece fresh ginger, sliced
* 2 tsp yellow mustard seeds
* 2 tsp coriander seeds
* 1 tsp salt

### Instructions
Fill a 4-cup measuring cup or bowl with the 2 1/2 cups boiling water. Add the shiitakes and use a small glass or bowl to weigh down the mushrooms and keep them submerged. Let them sit until soft, 30 minutes.

Remove the mushrooms from the water (reserving the water). Snip off the stems and discard (or save for another use -- they're too tough to eat). Cut the caps in half, or into slices.

Pour 1 cup of the reserved water into a saucepan. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger, mustard seeds, coriander seeds and salt to the pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the mushrooms and return to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low.

Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is reduced and the mushrooms are soft, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.

Use a slotted spoon to transfer the mushrooms to a clean pint jar. Pour in enough of the simmering liquid to cover. Close the jar tightly and refrigerate. These will keep for a month or so.
