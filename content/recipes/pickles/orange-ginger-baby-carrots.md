### Instructions
Blanch carrots in a nonreactive 4- to 5-qt heavy pot of salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Transfer carrots to an ice bath to stop cooking, then drain in a colander and transfer to a heatproof bowl

Bring vinegar, orange zest and juice, chiles, ginger, sugar, and 1 1/2 tsp salt to a boil in same pot, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Pour over carrots and cool, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour.

Chill carrots in pickling liquid in an airtight container, shaking container occasionally, at least 1 day.

These will keep, chilled, for 1 month (they will develop more flavor over time).
