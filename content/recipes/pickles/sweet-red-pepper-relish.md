### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* 12 sweet red bell peppers, seeded & diced
* 2 green bell peppers, seeded & diced
* 2-4 red or green jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
* 1 tbsp. salt
* 3 cups sugar
* 1 cup vinegar

</div>

### Instructions
Toss the diced peppers with the salt and let them stand in a colander for 3-4 hours.

Rinse the peppers thoroughly under cold running water to remove the salt. Place them in an enamel pot, add the sugar and vinegar, and bring the boil.  Simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Pack in sterile jars and store in the refrigerator.
