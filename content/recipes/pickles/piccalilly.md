### Instructions
In a large bowl, combine the chopped cucumbers, red peppers and green peppers.

In a large bowl, mix the pickling salt with 10 cups of cool water until the salt is mostly dissolved. Add this brine to the chopped vegetables. Put a plate on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged. Refrigerate for 12 hours.

Drain the vegetables well, but do not rinse.

Combine the vinegar and sugar in a pot and bring just to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the satchel with the pickling spice, the celery seeds and the mustard seeds. Simmer for a few minutes.

Add the drained vegetables and return to a boil. Stir in the crushed red pepper.

Fish out the spice bag and discard. Pack the hot vegetables into pint jars and then add the hot liquid, leaving 1/2” headspace. Process for 15 minutes using water bath method.
