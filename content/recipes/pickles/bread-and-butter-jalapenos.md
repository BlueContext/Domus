### Instructions
Cut the stem ends off of the jalapeños. Cut them in half lengthwise. Remove and discard the seeds and ribs. Place the peppers in a large glass or stainless steel bowl. Add the onions and stir in the salt, ensuring that it is evenly distributed. Cover the peppers with a clean kitchen towel, and top the towel with ice. Chill this in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours. 

Using plenty of cold water, rinse the salt from the peppers and onions. Drain them well. Rinse and drain them again.

In a large pot, combine the vinegars, sugar and spices. Bring to a boil until sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the peppers and the onions and return to a boil. As soon as they boil again, remove from the heat. 

Using a slotted spoon, pack the peppers into a clean (sterile) 1-quart jar, up to about an inch from the top. Pour the brine over the peppers to cover, carefully releasing any air bubbles.

Cover the jar and let cool to room temperature before refrigerating.
