title:  Pickled Watermelon Rind
serves: "Makes 10 pint"
summary: "Translucent pale green with bits of red, this makes a beautiful relish at the holiday table. The flavor is sweet – sweeter than a sweet pickle – and tangy, scented with clove and cinnamon. This is an old southern favorite and well worth trying! The whole spices are important for the flavor, but best picked out before serving. This is a bit of a project, but worth trying."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list"> 

* Rind of 1 large watermelon (about 5 quarts) – peel off the green outer skin and leave a small band of pink flesh on the inside.
* 7 cups sugar
* 3 cups white vinegar
* 2 rounded tsp. whole cloves
* 4 cinnamon sticks (broken in half)
* 4 slices ginger root (skin removed)
* 2 whole star anise
* 1 tsp. black peppercorns 
* ½ tsp. whole allspice
* ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes

### Instructions
Cut the rind into 1” cubes. Put a large pot of salted water on to boil. When it reaches a rolling boil, add the rind and cook for 3-5 minutes (just until it is tender when pierced with a fork). Don’t overcook, or your pickles will be mushy. Drain the rind.

Combine the sugar, vinegar and remaining ingredients in a large saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until boiling, stirring occasionally. Pour this syrup over the drained rind. After it cools, cover it and let it stand overnight.

Remove the rind and bring the syrup to a boil again. Boil for 5 minutes and then pour back over the rind. Let stand overnight.

On the third morning, pack the rind into sterile jars. Boil the syrup again and pour over the rind to overflowing.

Seal the jars and process using the water-bath method for 15 minutes (for pint jars).
