### Instructions
In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, blanch the carrots for 1 minute, drain in a colander, and stop cooking by refreshing under cold running water. Pack the carrot sticks upright  in 2 1-pint heatproof jars.

In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, 1 1/4 cups of water, the sugar, garlic, dill seeds and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.

Pour the hot mixture over the carrots, filling each jar to within 1/4” of the top of each jar.  Cover and chill for at least 24 hours and up to a week.
