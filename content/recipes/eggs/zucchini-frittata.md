### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 lb zucchini, grated (about a quart)  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
1 small shallot, minced  
Salt and black pepper  
8 large eggs  
1 tablespoon heavy cream  
2 oz chevre or other creamy goat cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill  

</div>

### Instructions

Heat 1 tbsp of oil over medium heat in a 10-inch heavy nonstick skillet. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until slightly softened.  Add the zucchini and cook, stirring, until it begins to wilt (about 2 minutes).  Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute or 2. The zucchini should be wilted down but still bright green. Season to taste and remove from the heat.

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Beat the eggs and the cream in a large bowl with the goat cheese. Season appropiately with salt and pepper, and stir in the zucchini and the dill.

Clean and dry the pan, and return to the burner over medium-high heat. Add the remaining oil -- when it shimmers, pour in the egg mixture. Tilt the pan to distribute the mixture evenly over the pan. Lift the congealed eggs from the bottom to allow the liquid eggs to flow down a couple of times during the first couple of minutes of cooking. Reduce heat to medium low and cook, shaking pan occasionally, until the pan is mostly set.

Place in the oven and cook for 10 minutes or so, until the entire egg mixture is set but still moist looking on top.

Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes. Gently loosen the edges with a spatula, and carefully slide the frittat from the pan onto a large round platter. Cut into wedges.

Serve hot, warm, or room temperature. Do not reheat (the eggs get so overcooked).
