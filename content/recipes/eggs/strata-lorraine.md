### Instructions
Butter a 3-quart gratin dish or other shallow baking dish.

Cut the bacon crosswise into ¼” strips or batons, and place in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook, stirring frequently, until all the bacon is crisp.  With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and set it aside.  Pour off all but 1 tbsp. of the bacon drippings.

Add the washed spinach to the hot pan, cover remove from heat (the residual heat in the pan should be enough to cook the spinach down.

After five minutes, uncover the spinach and stir.  It should be completely wilted down – if not, cover and place over medium heat for another couple of minutes.

Move the cooked spinach to a colander over the sink.  When it’s cool enough to handle, wring from it every last drop of water than you can.  Chop it finely and set aside.

Wipe the skillet to remove any spinach bits, add 1 tbsp. of the bacon drippings and the butter, and place over medium-high heat.  When the butter foam begins to subside, add the chopped onion and the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft.  Add the salt, pepper and nutmeg, and cook, stirring, for another minute.  Add the spinach and stir to combine thoroughly.  Add the crisped bacon, stir, and remove from the heat.

Whisk the eggs until they are a smooth, consistent liquid. Add the milk, mustard, a pinch of salt, a few grinds of black pepper, and a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce.  Whisk to combine everything very thoroughly.

Spread 1/3 of the bread cubes in the baking dish, top evenly with 1/3 of the spinach-bacon mixture, and sprinkle with 1/3 of the combined cheeses. Repeat layering two more times, ending with the cheese.

Pour the egg mixture carefully and evenly over the strata.  Cover with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 8 hours so that the bread can fully absorb the custard.

Let the strata stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 F. 

Bake the strata uncovered in the middle of the oven until it is puffed and golden, about 55 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
