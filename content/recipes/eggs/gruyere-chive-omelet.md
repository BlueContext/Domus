### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

8 large eggs  
4 tbsp finely chopped chives or scallions, divided  
Salt and black pepper  
6 tbsp salted butter, divided  
1/3 c. dry white wine or vermouth  
¼ c. whole grain mustard  
2 oz. crusty white bread, cut into rough ½" cubes (2 cups)  
4 oz (1 c) shredded Gruyere

### Instructions
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, 2 tablespoons of the chives, and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper.

In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter. Add the wine and mustard and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid has evaporated and the mixture begins to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, add the bread and toss to coat. Set the skillet over medium, add the seasoned bread and cook, stirring, until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes.

Transfer to a plate and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.

Set the skillet over medium-high and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When the butter has melted, swirl the pan to coat. Pour in the egg mixture and, using a silicone spatula, draw the edges toward the center and gently stir, working your way around the perimeter of the pan. Cook the eggs this way until they form soft, creamy curds on top and the bottom has set but not browned, about 1 minute.

Off heat, scatter the cheese over the omelet, cover and let stand until the cheese has melted and the surface of the omelet is set, about 3 minutes.

Run the spatula around the edge and underneath the omelet to loosen, then slide onto a cutting board.

Scatter the toasted bread over half of the omelet and, using the spatula, fold the omelet in half to enclose the bread. Cut the omelet into 4 wedges and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chives.
