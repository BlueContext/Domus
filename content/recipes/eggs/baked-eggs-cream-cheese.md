title: Baked Eggs in Cream & Cheese
serves: "Serves 4"
summary: "This is perfect for a brunch or breakfast with guests – the sort of occasion where you want an egg dish rather than just eggs, but you’d rather not spend your Saturday morning making Hollandaise sauce. It’s also just absurdly good. Be sure to serve with plenty of buttered toast for dipping in the delicious amalgam of egg yolks, cream and cheese."

A drop of white truffle oil added to the cream mixture is lovely. Or, if you should be so lucky, generously shave white truffle over the top of the finished dish for a truly luxurious dish.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

½ c. heavy cream  
4tbsp. grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (or 2 tbsp. Parmigiano and 2 tbsp. Gruyere)  
Tabasco sauce (optional)  
4 large eggs  

</div>

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 F. Butter 4 ramekins or soufflé cups. Put a medium saucepan full of water on to boil.

In a bowl, mix the cream, the cheese, a drop or two of Tabasco sauce, a pinch of salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. 

Divide this mixture evenly among the ramekins, and break one egg into each. Place the ramekins in a baking dish and carefully pour the boiling water around the ramekins such that it comes halfway up their sides. 

Bake until the whites are barely set and the yolks are still runny, 12-14 minutes. They will likely seem under-done to you, but the ramekins are hot and the eggs will continue to cook on the plate.  Also,  the cream rises to the top and makes the eggs seem less cooked than they are.

Carefully place the ramekins on plates and serve with buttered toast.
