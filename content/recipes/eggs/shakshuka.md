1 tsp sweet paprika  
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 F.

Beat the eggs and the cream in a large bowl with the goat cheese. Season appropiately with salt and pepper, and stir in the zucchini and the dill.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook until very soft, about 20 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until tender and fragrant. Add the cumin, paprika and cayenne, and cook for 1 minute more.

Pour in the tomatoes and add the salt and pepper. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the sauce is thickened (about 10 minutes). Taste and correct seasoning as desired with salt, pepper, and drops of Tabasco.

Use the back of a spoon to make 6 depressions on the surface of the mixture.  Gently crack an egg into each depression. Season with salt and pepper, cover, and transfer to the oven to bake until the eggs are just set -- this only takes a few minutes, and you don't want to overcook the eggs, so watch it carefully.

Top with cilantro and serve.  Warm flour tortillas or tosted crusty bread are equally wonderful with this.
