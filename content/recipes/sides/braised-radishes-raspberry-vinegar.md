title: Braised Radishes with Raspberry Vinegar
serves: "Serves 4"
summary: "If you’re looking for an interesting vegetable side-dish, this unusual recipe will fit the bill. And it’s good, I promise! Cooked radishes have a firm-tender texture something like a cooked turnip, but the flavor is much superior. Raspberry vinegar is worth seeking out for this, but red wine vinegar makes a reasonable substitute."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lb trimmed radishes, rinsed and dried  
2 1/2 tbsp sugar  
1/3 cup raspberry vinegar  
1 tbsp butter  
1/2 tsp salt  
1 tbsp minced fresh parsley or chives  

</div>

### Instructions
In a skillet or saucepan just large enough to hold the radishes in a single layer, combine the sugar, the vinegar, the butter, the salt, 1/2 cup of water, and any radishes that are significantly larger than the others. Cover and bring to a boil, then add the rest of the radishes.

Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes, until they are just tender throughout when pierced with a paring knife. Transfer the radishes with a slotted spoon to a bowl and keep them covered and warm. 

Boil the braising liquid until it is reduced to about 1/4 cup and has a slightly thickened consistency of a glaze. Return the radishes to the pan, season with salt and pepper to taste, and swirl to coat with the glaze.

Sprinkle the radishes with the minced chives to serve.
