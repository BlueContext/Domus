title: French Fries
serves: "Serves 4"
summary: "Perfect French fries — crusty and golden on the outside with creamy interiors — can be produced at home, but it requires planning and careful attention to detail. The initial frying can be done early in the day, so that only the final flash-frying need be done right before serving."

As a bonus, twice-baked potatoes can be made the day before, and need only be popped in the oven for 30-40 minutes on the day.

### Instructions
Peel the potatoes and cut them into roughly 1/3-inch square batons. Place them in a colander and rinse them thoroughly under running water. 

Place them in a saucepan filled with cold water. Bring the water to a gentle boil and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Drain them thoroughly in a colander. Spread the potatoes on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet, cover with a paper towel and refrigerate for at least an hour, preferably two.

Heat the oil to 360 F in a Dutch oven or large, deep saucepan. Cook the fries a few handfuls at a time for about 2 minutes.  At this stage, we do not want the fries to brown or crisp. Remove them from the fat to a bowl and set aside.  The fries can be prepared well in advance up to this point.

Heat the oil to 400 and cook the fries until they are crisp and golden, about 5 minutes. Remove the fries to paper to drain. Season them with fine salt as soon as they come out of the oil.
