### Instructions
Place the carrots in a heavy bottom 2-quart saucepan with the sugar, water, 1 1/2 tbsp butter, salt and pepper. Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce heat; simmer slowly for about 30 minutes, or until the carrots are tender and the liquid is mostly evaporated. Correct seasoning.

Just before serving, reheat quickly and toss with parsley and the additional butter.
