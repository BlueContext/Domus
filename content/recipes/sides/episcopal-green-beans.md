title: Episcopal Green Beans
serves: "Serves 6-8"
summary: "Despite their name, you need not be a bishop or even an Episcopalian to enjoy these. This is my version of a dish that was served annually at the parish Thanksgiving dinner of the Episcopal Church in Brenham, Texas. I found it years ago in an old community cookbook."
