A probe thermometer is key, since reaching the correct internal temperature makes all the difference. Serve them as soon as possible — they need to be cut open soon after coming out of the oven, or the steam will be reabsorbed and the interior will turn gummy.

### Instructions
Check that your oven rack is clean. Preheat the oven to 400 F.

Rinse the potatoes, scrubbing lightly to get off any last bits of dirt. Dry them thoroughly and immediately (the skins can get soggy). Prick each potato with a fork in a few of places. Contrary to kitchen lore, potatoes are unlikely to “explode”, but allowing steam to escape produces a fluffier, drier interior.

Rub the skins lightly with oil, and season them all over with kosher salt.

Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack, with at least an inch of open space on all sides.  Bake for about 30-45 minutes — it depends on the size and moisture content of the potatoes, but it’s easy to tell when they’re done: an internal temperature of no less than 210 F degrees is the sweet spot.
