### Instructions
In a skillet, heat the olive oil with the garlic over medium heat, and cook the garlic until softened but not browned. Add the artichokes and sautee them until they begin to get a just a bit of browning on some edges. Stir in the herbs and lemon juice, season with salt and black pepper to taste, and cook for a minute more. Add the wine and red pepper flakes and continue cooking until the wine is mostly cooked away. Stir in the parsley, remove from the heat and serve.
