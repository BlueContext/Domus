### Instructions
Peel the eggplant and cut into batonnets (1 ½” long by ¼” wide). Cut the zucchini into the same shape. Slice the ends off of the peppers and remove the seeds and ribs. Cut the peppers into strips a similar size to the eggplant and zucchini.

Heat 3 tbsp. olive oil in a large frying pan over high heat until very hot. Add the eggplant and zucchini and sauté until golden brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.

Heat the remaining 6 tbsp. olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers and cook until soft but not colored. Add the garlic, herbs, tomatoes, tomato paste and the sautéed zucchini and eggplant. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Proceed with one of the following options.

Stewed: Simmer over low heat, without stirring, for 20 minutes. Taste for seasoning and serve.

Baked: Pour the mixture into a baking dish. Sprinkle with a small amount of grated Parmeggiano Regiano cheese and bake in a 350 F oven for 15-20 minutes. Serve hot or room temperature.
