<div class="ingredient-list">

1 1/2 cups half-and-half or whole milk  
Salt and pepper  
2 tbsp butter, plus extra for greasing the dish  
2 medium leeks, white and tender green parts diced (about 2 cups)  
1 tsp chopped fresh thyme  
2 garlic cloves, minced  
Cayenne to taste  
Grated nutmeg to taste  
4 oz cooked ham steak, cut into a dice

1 oz finely grated Parmesan

### Instructions
Heat oven to 375F. Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until tender, then drain, and place in a large bowl. Mash the potatoes with the half-and-half, and cool slightly.

Heat 2 tbsp butter in a skillet over moderate heat. Add the leeks, season with salt and pepper, and cook until  well-softened but still bright green (about 4 minutes). Add thyme and garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the cooked leeks to the mashed potatoes and mix to combine. Add the cayenne, nutmeg, ham, and fontina and/or Gruyère. Mix well, taste, and correct seasoning. The mixture should be highly seasoned, as the eggs will dilute the mixture when added. Beat in the three egg yolks.

Butter a 2 quart baking dish and sprinkle the bottom and sides with the grated Parmesan. 

In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Stir 1/3 of the egg whites into the potato mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whites in two portions, and scrape the soufflé into the prepared dish. Sprinkle the top with a bit of remaining Parmesan.

Bake for 40 minutes, until nicely browned and a skewer or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  May rest up to 10 minutes before serving.
