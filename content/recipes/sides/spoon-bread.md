### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 cup stone-ground cornmeal (Lamb’s is best)  
3 cups milk  
1 tsp salt  
1 tsp sugar  
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste)  
1 tbsp butter, melted, plus extra for greasing the pan  
4 egg yolks, beaten  
4 egg whites, whipped to stiff peaks  

</div>

### Instructions
Grease a 2—quart baking dish. In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the cornmeal, milk, salt, sugar, cayenne and butter. Cook, stirring constantly, until you have thick mush. Set aside to cool. 

Preheat the oven to 350.

Whip the egg whites to soft peaks with a pinch of salt.

When the corn mush is cool (really, no more than slightly warm), beat in the egg yolks. Gently fold in the egg whites, until just combined, and pour the mixture into the baking dish. 

Bake for 1 hour or until a skewer comes out mostly clean.  Serve at once.
