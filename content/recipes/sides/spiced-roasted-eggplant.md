### Ingredients
Harissa can sometimes be found at the grocery store, but it’s easily found online as well. It has some heat to it, but if you’d like more, a dollop of Sambal Olek or other chili paste will work well.

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 tbsp. coriander seeds  
* 1 tbsp. cumin seeds  
* 2 tbsp. vegetable oil   
* 2 eggplants (1 lb. each)  
* 6 tbsp. olive oil  
* 1/4 cup harissa paste  
* 1/4 cup cider vinegar  
* 3 tbsp. honey  
* 1 medium garlic clove, grated finely  
* 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh mint  
* 3 tbsp finely chopped fresh dill, divided

### Instructions
In a small skillet over medium, toast the coriander and cumin, shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder and let cool slightly, then pulse until coarsely ground; set aside. (You can use a mortar and pestle instead of the spice grinder.)

Heat the oven to broil with a rack 6 inches from the element. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and mist with cooking spray. Cut each eggplant crosswise into 1½-inch-thick rounds, then cut each round into 1½-inch cubes. In a large bowl, toss the eggplant with the oil to coat. Distribute in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet; reserve the bowl. Season the eggplant lightly with salt. Broil without stirring until tender and lightly charred on top, 10 to 12 minutes. If the eggplant isn’t tender all the way through, turn off the broiler and bake for a few minutes more at 350.

Meanwhile, in the reserved bowl, whisk together the harissa, vinegar, honey, garlic, mint, 2 tablespoons of dill and the coriander and cumin. When the eggplant is done, immediately add it to the bowl, then gently toss to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Let stand for 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon dill.
