### Instructions
Combine all of the beans in a large mixing bowl and set aside.  Lightly grease a 10x15 baking dish and set aside.

In a large skillet, fry the bacon over medium-high heat until it begins to crisp. Add the onion and continue cooking until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the sugar, vinegar, water, mustard seeds, 1 tsp. salt and ½ tsp. cracked black pepper. Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture reduces by half and is a rich brown color (about 20 minutes).

While the mixture simmers, preheat the oven to 350 F.

Add the simmered sauce mixture to the beans and mix thoroughly. Pour the beans into the prepared baking dish, spreading it evenly. Bake the beans for 1 hour or until the bubbling and lightly browned.

Let the casserole stand for 15 minutes before serving.
