### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lb sweet potatoes, peeled  
2 tbsp olive oil  
2 oz (about 1/2 cup) grated Jarlsberg cheese  

</div>

### Instructions
Heat oven to 450F. 

Cut the sweet potatoes into 1/8” slices (a mandoline or a food processor fitted with a slicing disc works best). Coat the bottom of 9” nonstick cake pan or oven-proof nonstick skillet with a scant tablespoon of olive oil. Arrange half of the sweet potato slices, overlapping each other, in a circular pattern to form a single layer on the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the Jarlsberg evenly over the potatoes and season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange the remaining sweet potato slices over the cheese, overlapping them as with the first layer. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of oil over the potatoes, and season with salt and pepper.

Take a piece of aluminum foil large enough to cover the potatoes, spray it with cooking spray, and place it (oiled side down) over the potatoes. Weight the cake down with a heavy ovenproof saucepan or skillet on top of the foil.

Cook the galette over moderate heat for about 5 minutes after you start hearing the oil sizzle. Remove the saucepan and the foil (carefully!), and transfer the galette to the oven to bake for 10 minutes more, or until the potatoes are completely tender.

Remove from the oven, invert a plate over the pan, and carefully invert them both to unmold the galette. Cut into 4 wedges and serve.
