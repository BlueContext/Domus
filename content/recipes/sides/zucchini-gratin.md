### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped fine
* 2 cloves garlic, minced fine
* 1 lb Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 
* 2 1/2 lbs zucchini, sliced 1/4 inch thick
* 4 medium tomatoes, sliced
* 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/4 tsp dried)
* 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese
* 1 tsbp finely chopped parsley

</div>

### Instructions
Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until very soft but not browned. Add the chopped garlic and the diced tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are almost a puree, about 15 minutes. Spread this mixture over the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch gratin or baking dish.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.

Arrange the sliced zucchini and sliced tomatoes in alternating rows on top of the tomato-onion mixture. Sprinkle with thyme leaves and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Sprinkle the cheese evenly and sparsely over everything. Bake until the cheese is lightly browned and the vegetables are soft, 20 to 25 minutes.

Sprinkle with the parsley and serve in the gratin dish.
