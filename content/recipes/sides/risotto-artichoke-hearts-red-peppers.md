### Instructions
In a small saucepan, dilute the broth with 2 cups of water and bring it to a simmer.

In a heavy saucepan, cook the bell pepper and artichoke hearts in 1 tbsp of olive oil over moderate heat for 2 minutes.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a small bowl, and set aside.

Add the remaining oil to the saucepan and return to the heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until the onions are softened. Add the prosciutto and cook for another minute. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until the rice is coated with oil and quite hot.  

Add the wine and cook, stirring constantly, over moderately high heat until the wine is absorbed completely. 

Add 1/2 cup of warm stock and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until it’s absorbed before adding another 1/2 cup of stock. Proceed in this manner, always stirring, until only 1/2 cup of stock remains.

Stir in the vegetables and 1/3 cup of the remaining stock. Simmer, stirring, for 1 minute. At this point, the rice should be very creamy, but each individual grain should have the slightest al dente bite. If needed, add the remaining stock and cook, stirring, until absorbed. 

Remove from heat and stir in the Parmesan and parsley. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and a pinch of white pepper. Serve at once.
