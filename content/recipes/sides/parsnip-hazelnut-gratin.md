Preheat oven to 400°F. 

Sauté bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to large bowl. Stir in parsnips and 1/4 cup hazelnuts. Arrange mixture in even layer in 2-quart baking dish. 

Combine whipping cream, broth, salt, and pepper in medium bowl. Pour over parsnip mixture in dish.
