title: Spiced Saffron Rice
serves: "Serves 6"
summary: "It’s worth seeking out Basmati rice that’s been imported from India. The rice’s rich floral aroma is created by aging the dried grains for months; domestic producers don’t bother, resulting in bland and uninteresting rice."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 1/2 c imported Basmati rice  
2 tbsp. vegetable oil   
A 3-inch cinnamon stick  
7 whole cloves  
5 green cardamom pods  
1 tsp salt   
1/4 tsp crumbled saffron threads  
1 tbsp milk

### Instructions
In a large bowl, wash the rice in several changes of cold water until the water no longer becomes cloudy. Drain in a fine sieve and set aside to dry.

In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Fry the whole spices, stirring constantly, until the cloves are puffed (about 3 seconds). Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute (the rice should become opaque). Add 2 1/4 cups water and the salt, bring the mixture to a boil, and cook the rice, covered, for 15 minutes over low heat.

While the rice is cooking, place the saffron in a very small pan or saucepan and hold it over low heat for just long enough for the saffron threads to become brittle. Add the milk and keep over heat just until the milk is very hot. Remove from heat and set aside for 1 minute, and then drizzle this mixture over the rice. Allow the rice to finish cooking.  Test a few grains — is the rice isn’t done (or there’s still water at the bottom of the pot), cook for 5 minutes more.

Remove from heat and set aside, covered, for 5 minutes before serving.
