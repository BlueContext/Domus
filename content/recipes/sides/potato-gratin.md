### Instructions

Thinly slice potatoes using mandoline. Set aside. 

Shred cheeses and add to a medium bowl with cornstarch. Toss to coat. Layer as follows in an 8”x8” baking pan - each potato layer should be perpendicular to the last: 

Layer 1: lay down a layer of potatoes. Potatoes should overlap about 30%. Season lightly with salt and pepper. 
Layer 2: potatoes, top with ⅕ of the grated cheese mix. 
Layer 3: potatoes, season lightly with salt and pepper. 
Layer 4: potatoes, top with ⅕ of the grated cheese mix. 
Layer 5: potatoes, season lightly with salt and pepper. 
Layer 6: potatoes, top with ⅕ of the grated cheese mix. 
Layer 7: potatoes, season lightly with salt and pepper. 
Layer 8: top layer potatoes. Mix chicken stock and cream in a small container and pour mix evenly  over the top of the layered potatoes.  

Finish by topping with the remaining grated cheeses, making sure to fully cover the potatoes. 

Cover with foil. bake in preheated 325F oven for 70-90min. After 45 minutes of baking remove foil. Continue baking for remaining 45 minutes. Use a cake tester or thin knife to check that potatoes are fully cooked. It’s done when you don’t feel much resistance. Cover with foil until ready to serve.
