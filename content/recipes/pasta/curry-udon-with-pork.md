Frozen udon and ramen noodles are worth dedicating some freezer space to, as they make so many quick and filling meals possible. If you have an electric kettle, you don't even need to turn on a burner. Just pour boiling water over the frozen noodles in a heatproof bowl and let them sit for a few minutes, until hot through.  Drain and use.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

5-6 cups dashi (Japanese sea stock)  
2 tablespoons oil  
1 onion, sliced  
1 lb thinly sliced pork  
3 tablespoons sake  
3-4 blocks Japanese curry roux  
1 tablespoon soy sauce  
4 packages frozen udon  
3 scallions, thinly sliced  

</div>

### Instructions
Prepare the dashi stock.

In a large, deep frying pan or Dutch oven, heat oil on med-high and saute the onion until soft, about 10 minutes. Add pork and increase heat until high. Stir-fry until nearly cooked through.

Add stock and sake to the pan, bring to a boil. Skim any scum and fat that rises. Cook on medium for 10 minutes.

Turn off the heat and add curry roux. Stir until dissolved. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring the bottom with a wooden spoon.

Refresh udon in boiling water, drain well. Set aside.

Add soy sauce to the curry mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Serve udon in a bow; topped with curry (or combine the noodles and curry).  Top with sliced scallions.
