Frozen udon and ramen noodles are worth dedicating some freezer space to, as they make so many quick and filling meals possible. If you have an electric kettle, you don't even need to turn on a burner. Just pour boiling water over the frozen noodles in a heatproof bowl and let them sit for a few minutes, until hot through.  Drain and use.

### Instructions
Prep all ingredients in advance. Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Stir well and set aside.

Submerge the noodles in boiling water just until they are hot through; drain and set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger and scallions, and fry until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add the onion, bell pepper, jalapeno, carrot, snow peas, and water chestnuts. Cook and stir for another 30 seconds, until the veggies just start to turn tender.

Add the noodles over the vegetables. Go Toss to combine.

Pour the sauce over the vegetables and noodles. Stir and mix until the noodles and vegetables are evenly coated. Cook for another minute until the vegetables are cooked through but remain crisp. Taste the noodles carefully, add a pinch of salt to your taste if needed.
