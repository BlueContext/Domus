### Instructions
Preheat oven to 450F.  In a rimmed baking sheet, toss the eggplant with 1 tbsp olive oil and salt and pepper to taste, and roast in the oven until golden and tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

While the eggplant is roasting, in a heavy skillet cook the onion, garlic, and bell pepper with salt and pepper to taste in the remaining tbsp olive oil over medium heat, stirring, until softened.

Add tomatoes and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes and peppers are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Stir in the vinegar and roasted eggplant.

In a large kettle of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve 3/4 cup of paste cooking water, and drain pasta well. In a bowl, toss pasta with sauce, ricotta, basil, a handful of Parmesan, salt and pepper to taste, and enough of the pasta water to emulsify into a light sauce. Serve immediately.
