Frozen udon and ramen noodles are worth dedicating some freezer space to, as they make so many quick and filling meals possible. If you have an electric kettle, you don't even need to turn on a burner. Just pour boiling water over the frozen noodles in a heatproof bowl and let them sit for a few minutes, until hot through.  Drain and use.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 Inari age (seasoned fried tofu pouches), drained, each cut in half to produce 4 squares  
* 4 cup Dashi (made from scratch if possible, since it's a prominent flavor in this dish)    
* 1/4-1/2 tsp salt  
* 2 Tbsp Soy sauce  
* 3 Tbsp Mirin  
* 2 Tbsp Sake  
* 2 packages of frozen Udon, thawed  
* 4 green onions, thinly cut  
* Shichimi Togarashi (hot pepper powder)

### Instructions
Heat Dashi to a boil, and add salt, Soy Sauce, Mirin, Sake.

Add Udon to the soup and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes.

Divide noodles and soup into bowls, place cooked Aburaage on top, and sprinkle on the chopped green onion. Add Shichimi if you like.
