<div class="ingredient-list">

</div>

### Instructions
Place potatoes in a large pot of water; bring to a boil.

Add salt and cavatappi or other short tubular pasta; return to a boil; cook 2 minutes.

Add green beans. Return to a boil; cook until vegetables are tender and pasta is al dente, about 6 minutes.

Drain; toss with pesto; season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.

#### Cook's Notes:
Widely used in Mediterranean cooking, basil is aromatic and slightly pungent. Basil's delicate leaves are best used raw or added at the end of the cooking process.
