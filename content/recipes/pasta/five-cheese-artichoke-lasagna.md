1 teaspoon olive oil

½ teaspoon ground black pepper  
6 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)  
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1 cup)  
1 ½ cups part-skim ricotta cheese  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves plus an additional 2 teaspoons  
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 medium shallot, minced (about 3 tablespoons)  
1 medium clove garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)  
⅓ cup all-purpose flour  
2 ½ cups whole milk  
1 ½ cups low-sodium chicken broth  
Pinch cayenne pepper  
1 bay leaf  
15 no-boil lasagna noodles (1 box Barilla, 2 boxes other brands)

Notes: It’s important to not overbake this lasagna. Once the sauce starts bubbling around the edges, turn the oven to broil. If your lasagna pan is not broiler-safe, brown the lasagna at 500 degrees for about 10 minutes.

### Instructions
Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss artichokes with oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper until evenly coated; spread over prepared baking sheet. Roast, rotating baking sheet from front to back, until artichokes are browned at edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Let artichokes cool and then chop coarsely. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, place Gruyère and 1/2 cup Parmesan in large heatproof bowl. Combine ricotta, egg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley in medium bowl. Set both bowls aside.

Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat until foaming; add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly combined, about 1 1/2 minutes; mixture should not brown. Gradually whisk in milk and broth; increase heat to medium-high and bring to full boil, whisking frequently. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, cayenne, and bay leaf, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon and making sure to scrape bottom and corners of saucepan (you should have about 4 cups).

Remove saucepan from heat and discard bay leaf. Gradually whisk 1/4 cup sauce into ricotta mixture. Pour remaining sauce over Gruyère mixture and stir until smooth; set aside while softening noodles.

Place noodles in 13 by 9-inch baking dish and cover with very hot tap water; soak 10 minutes, agitating noodles occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove noodles from water, place in single layer on kitchen towel, and pat dry. Wipe out baking dish and spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray.

Distribute 1/2 cup sauce in bottom of baking dish. Place 3 noodles in single layer on top of sauce. Spread 1/2 cup ricotta mixture evenly over noodles and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 cup fontina, 3 tablespoons gorgonzola, 1/3 cup roasted artichokes, and about 2 tablespoons proscuitto. Drizzle 1/2 cup sauce evenly over cheese. Repeat layering of noodles, ricotta, fontina, Gorgonzola, artichokes, proscuitto, and sauce 3 more times. Place final 3 noodles on top and cover completely with remaining sauce, spreading with rubber spatula and allowing to spill over noodles. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan.

Spray large sheet foil with nonstick cooking spray and cover lasagna; bake until edges are just bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking time. Remove foil and turn oven to broil. Broil until surface is spotty brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons parsley; cut into pieces and serve.
