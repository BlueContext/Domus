### Instructions
In a small bowl, mix the tomatoes with 1/2 tsp salt and set aside.  

In a large pot, bring 2 1/2 qts water to a boil.  Add the corn cobs and 1 tbsp salt, reduce to medium, and cook, covered, for 10 minutes.  Using tongs, remove and discard the cobs. Remove pot from the heat.

In a 12-inch non-sticks  skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tbsp of butter. Add the grated corn, shallots, chili and 1 tsp salt. Cook, stirring, until the shallots have softened (about 5 min). Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the cooking water and cook, uncovered, over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened (10-15 min).

Return the remaining corn-infused water to the boil.  Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water, and drain the pasta.  Add pasta to the skillet and cook over medium, stirring constantly, until the pasta is coated and the sauce is creamy, about 2 min.  Add some reserved cooking water if needed to reach proper consistency.

Off the heat, add the remaining 2 tbsp butter, the tomatoes with their juices, and the basil.  Toss until the butter is melted and everything is incorporated. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
