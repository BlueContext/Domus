Frozen udon and ramen noodles are worth dedicating some freezer space to, as they make so many quick and filling meals possible. If you have an electric kettle, you don't even need to turn on a burner. Just pour boiling water over the frozen noodles in a heatproof bowl and let them sit for a few minutes, until hot through.  Drain and use.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 packages frozen Udon noodles

1 tablespoon sugar, divided  
8 ounces flank steak

4 garlic cloves, minced  
1 tbsp grated fresh ginger  
1/2 tablespoon curry powder

### Instructions
In a medium bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Cut the steak in half with the grain, then cut each piece across the grain into ¼-inch slices. Add the steak to the soy mixture and toss. Marinate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.

In a large pot bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool. Set aside. OR Use boiling water to refresh frozen udon. Drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside.

In a 12-inch non stick skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the steak and any accumulated juices and cook, stirring constantly, until no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.

To the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat over medium until shimmering. Add the scallion whites, garlic, ginger and curry powder. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the cabbage, bell pepper, the remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until the thick rib pieces of the cabbage are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.
 
Add the noodles and toss. Add the steak and any accumulated juices and toss again. Off heat, taste and season with salt, then stir in the scallion greens. Serve with lime wedges.
