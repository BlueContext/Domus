Frozen udon and ramen noodles are worth dedicating some freezer space to, as they make so many quick and filling meals possible. If you have an electric kettle, you don't even need to turn on a burner. Just pour boiling water over the frozen noodles in a heatproof bowl and let them sit for a few minutes, until hot through.  Drain and use.

### Instructions
Prepare your vegetables and set aside. 

Mix up the sauce by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. 

Place the frozen udon in a heatproof bowl and pour boiling water over them. When they are heated through, drain and set aside.

In a large frying pan or wok, heat chili oil over medium-high heat until very hot. Add tofu and cook, stirring for a minute or so. Add onions, carrots, mushrooms and cook, stirring, until onions are soft and carrots are tender. (feel free to add any other veggies you have on hand) Add green onion, bean sprouts and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so.

If soaking udon noodles, gently stir to loosen udon noodles and separate, then drain. Add drained noodles (or unsoaked noodles) to the wok and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so. (Stir fry a little longer if soaked, to cook off any extra water before adding the sauce). Add sauce and cook for another 30 second, stirring to combine well.

Remove stir fry to a bowl or plate and garnish with sesame seeds, additional sliced green onion or chopped peanuts. Enjoy!
