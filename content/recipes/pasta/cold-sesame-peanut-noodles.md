### Instructions
Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.

Peel the cucumber, prep other vegetables as neccessary, and cut them all into small matchsticks. Set aside.

In a bowl large enough to hold everything, whisk together the sesame oil, tahini, peanut butter, sugar, soy sauce, ginger, Sambal Olek, rice vinegar, lime juice, chili oil to taste, and black pepper to taste.

Cook the noodles per the package instructions.  Thin the sauce a bit with a few spoonfuls of the cooking water.

Drain the noodles, rinse under cold water until very cool, and drain again. 

Toss the noodles and vegetables in the sauce until well-combined. Correct seasoning if neccessary and serve.
