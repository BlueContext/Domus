title: Oyster Stew II
serves: "Serves 6-8"
summary: "This is more like the Oyster Stew my grandparents served in Iowa, albeit with canned oysters when fresh are sorely wanted here. There's something truly appealing about the simplicity of it, though -- less a stew than hot buttery milk flavored with the lovely saline subtlety of oysters. "

2 to 3 8-ounce jars of fresh oysters (24 to 36 oysters, shucked)

### Instructions

Heat milk in double boiler (or just on low heat).

Dice oysters and place in stew pan with 1 cup water, butter, celery salt, salt, and pepper.

Bring to simmer and simmer gently for seven minutes.

Add oyster mixture to milk in double boiler.

Simmer gently at least two hours. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it is, or if it sets overnight it becomes more flavorful. Stir well and season to taste with salt, pepper, and drops of Tabasco Sauce. Serve with oyster crackers.
