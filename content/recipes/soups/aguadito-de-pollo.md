The aji amarillo paste isn’t common in American supermarkets, and unfortunately there’s no real substitute for it. It can be hand very easily online.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 tbsp oil  
4 medium garlic cloves, minced  
1 medium white onion, finely chopped  
1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems minced, leaves left whole and reserved separately  
1/4 cup aji amarillo paste  
Salt and black pepper  
1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or legs  
1 cup white rice, rinsed and drained  
3-4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks  
1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed and cut into 1/2-inch chunks  
1 cup frozen peas  
2 tbsp fresh lime juice

### Instructions

In a large pot over medium-high heat the oil until shimmering. Add the garlic, onion, cilantro stems, aji amarillo paste and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the paste begins to brown on the bottom of the pot, about 8 minutes. Add 7 cups water and bring to a simmer, scraping up the browned bits. Add the chicken in an even layer, then return to a simmer. Cover and cook, adjusting heat to maintain a simmer, until a fork inserted at the thickest part of the meat meets no resistance, about 40 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside until cool enough to handle.

In a blender, combine the cilantro leaves, a pinch of salt and ⅓ cup water. Blend, scraping the sides as needed, until smooth, about 1 minute. You should have about ½ cup puree. Set aside.

To the pot, stir in the rice, carrots, bell pepper, and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high, then cover, reduce to low and cook without stirring until the rice and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, shred the chicken into bite-size pieces, discarding the skin and bones.

When the rice and vegetables are tender, stir the shredded chicken and peas into the soup. Cook until the peas are heated through, about 1 minute. Off-heat, stir in the cilantro puree and lime juice, then taste and season with salt and pepper.
