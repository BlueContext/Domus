### Instructions

Drain and chop the dried mushrooms once they are softened.

Saute onions, leeks, carrots, parsnips and garlic until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper and sage. Cook until the mushrooms have softened.

Add the Madeira and reduce by half over high heat. Stir in rice, barley and stock. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer covered for about 40 minutes or until the rice is tender. Serve garnished with sliced raw scallions.
