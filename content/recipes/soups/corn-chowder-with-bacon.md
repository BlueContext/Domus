### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 3 thick slices bacon, cut into lardons  
* 1 onion, chopped  
* 5 large Yukon Gold potatoes, diced  
* 3 cup sweet corn (cut from 4 ears)  
* 1 quart whole milk  
* 3 tbsp butter  
* Salt and black pepper  
* 1 sleeve Saltine crackers   

</div>

### Instructions

Simmer the diced potatoes in water for 5 minutes to soften. Reserve 2 cups of the water, drain the rest, and set aside the potatoes and reserved water.

Render the bacon over medium heat in a soup pot. When the bacon is crisp, add the chopped onion and cook until very soft and browned. Add the potatoes and reserved water. Add the corn, milk and butter. Add salt to taste (but under-salt it a bit, since the Saltines are quite salty).

Crush 1/2 sleeve of the saltines to crumbs and add to the pot. Simmer for a bit, until everything is well-combined and the soup is thickened. Add pepper and any additional salt, to taste.  Serve with the remaining Saltines.
