### Instructions

In a large pot over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering and add the garlic, ginger, and Thai red curry paste. Fry for 5 minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken and cook for a couple minutes, until the chicken turns opaque.

Add the chicken broth, water, fish sauce, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil. Add the noodles to the broth and return to a boil. Taste the broth for salt and adjust seasoning accordingly (add salt if needed, or if it's too salty, add a bit of water). Pour the boiling soup into your serving bowls, add a squeeze of lime juice and your garnishes, and serve.
