### Instructions

Place the green onion, brown onion, chiles, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, cooking wine, sugar and water in a large pot over high heat. Stir to combine and bring to the boil. 

Add the chicken, breast-side down. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 30 minutes. 

Remove from the heat, cover with a tight-fitting lid and allow to stand for 1 hour. 

Remove the chicken from the stock and allow to cool slightly. Shred the chicken, discarding the skin and bones, and set aside. 

Strain the stock into a large heatproof bowl, discarding the solids. Allow to cool. Skim any excess fat from the surface.
