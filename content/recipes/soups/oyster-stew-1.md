title: Oyster Stew I
serves: "Serves 6"
summary: "My deeply Midwestern grandparents always served oyster stew at Christmas. In those days, fresh oysters weren’t to be found in rural Iowa, and I have no idea where this tradition came from. Canned oysters not withstanding, this dish captured my imagination. I have never stopped loving its buttery richness and simple elegance. This recipe, from the famed Antoine’s restaurant in New Orleans, is certainly richer than my grandmother’s. I think you’ll like it."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

50 medium oysters, shucked (about 1 1/2 lbs) with 1 cup of the liquor reserved  
12 tbsp butter  
5 tbsp flour  
4 ribs celery, finely chopped  
4 cloves garlic, finely minced  
1 large onion, finely chopped  
1/2 c. parsley, chopped

2 c. whole milk  
2 c. heavy cream  

</div>

### Instructions

Combine oyster liquor with 1 cup water in a 2 quart saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the oysters just simmer just until their edges begin to curl, about 2 minutes. Strain the oysters through a fine sieve set over a medium bowl. Reserve oysters and cooking liquid separately.

Heat butter in a 4-quart pot over medium high heat. Add flour and cook, whisking constantly, until golden brown (3-4 minutes). Reduce heat to medium. Add celery, garlic, onions, parsley, salt, pepper and cayenne. Cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until onions and celery are very soft, about 25 minutes.

Stir in the milk, cream, and reserved oysters with their cooking liquid. Stir occasionally until the soup is just hot, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
