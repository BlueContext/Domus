## Introduction

This recipe has a beautifully warm color and a nutty, rich flavor. The interesting combination of bay and turmeric save the soup from being overly simple. It it would make an elegant first-course soup for a dinner party, but it’s also a great supper with bread and a salad or some fruit and cheese.

## Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
2-3 large leeks, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 4 cups)  
6 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 4 cups)  
2 teaspoons kosher salt  
Black pepper  
1 bay leaf  
1 teaspoon ground turmeric  
4 garlic cloves, minced  
6 cups water, chicken broth or vegetable broth  
Extra-virgin olive oil, crème fraîche or yogurt, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

Put olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add leeks and parsnips, and stir to coat. Add the 2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste. 

Let vegetables sizzle and cook, stirring frequently until nearly caramelized, but without browning, until softened, 10 to 15 minutes. 

Add bay leaf, turmeric and garlic, and stir to coat. Increase heat to high, add water or broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes more. Taste broth and adjust seasoning. 

With a blender, purée soup to a creamy consistency. (An immersion blender is easiest — if using a standing blender, be sure to work in small batches.) Thin with water or broth, if necessary — it should be like a thin milkshake, not thick and porridge-like. 

Reheat the soup before serving. Serve plain, or give each bowl a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil or a dollop of crème fraîche or yogurt, if desired.
