6 tbsp olive oil  
4 tsp sweet or hot paprika   
1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika  
6 oz sourdough or other country-style bread, shaved thin (about 4 cups, divided 1 and 3)

### Instructions

In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the scallion whites, garlic, and 3 tbsp of oil. Cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to color, 8 to 10 minutes. Add both paprikas and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds or so.

Add 1 cup of the bread and stir well. Whisk in the water and stock, increase heat to medium high and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, whisking occasionally to break up the bread, for 15 minutes. Whisk vigorously to make sure that the bread is completely broken up and incorporated.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, combine the remaining 3 tbsp oil, the remaining bread, and 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until growned and crisp.  Season with some additional paprika and stir in the scallion greens.

In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of the hot soup. Remove soup from the heat and vigorously whisk in the egg yoks, then whisk in the vinegar. Taste and correct seasoning. To serve, fill individual bowls with the soup, drizzle with additional oil to taste, and top with the crisped bread.
