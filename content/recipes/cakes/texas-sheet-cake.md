### Instructions
#### Make the Cake:
Butter and flour a 10" by 15" cake pan. Preheat the oven to 400F. 

In a medium, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, vanilla and baking soda until smooth. Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.

Place the butter, shortening, cocoa powder and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. 

Pour the hot mixture over the flour mixture and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until combined and smooth. Scrape this mixture into the buttermilk mixture, and continue stirring vigorously just until completely combined.\

Wash and dry the saucepan -- you'll need it in a minute.

Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 20 minutes, or until the edges pull away from the pan and the center springs back when touched.  

#### Make the Icing:
When the cake has been in the oven for about 10 minutes, place the powdered sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer (or another mixing bowl if using a hand mixer). Combine the butter, buttermilk, and cocoa powder in your medium saucepan. Bring it a boil and quickly remove from the heat (it can scorch on the bottom). Mix to combine everything thoroughly. This won't look great. 

Pour the hot mixture into the powdered sugar, add the vanilla, and mix with the mixer until smooth. Stir in a cup of pecan pieces. 

Spread the icing over the still-hot cake, covering the entire surface. Sprinkle the additional pecan pieces over the icing as desired, and allow the cake to cool to room temperature. 

Cut into squares to serve.
