* 4 large eggs

### Instructions
Brush an 8‚Äù round cake pan with the melted butter, line the bottom with a round of parchment paper, and brush the paper with butter. Put the pan in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes (or until the butter is solidified), and dust it with 4 tsp of the sugar, shaking out the excess.

Preheat oven to 375 F.

In the top of a double-boiler set over barely simmering water, beat the eggs and 1/2 c of sugar with a whisk or electric mixer for 10-15 minutes or until the mixture is light and foamy.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl, sift the flour, the baking powder, and 2 tbsp of the cocoa powder over the top, and fold the dry ingredients into the mixture. 

Pour the batter into the pan and bake the cake in a preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the pan for 3 minutes, turn out onto a rack and let it cool completely.

In a chilled large bowl, beat the cream until it is foamy; beat in the remaining 1 cup sugar a bit at a time, and beat the cream until it holds soft peaks. Sift in the remaining 5 tbsp cocoa powder, add 2 tbsp of the Kahlua, and beat the mixture until it holds stiff peaks.

Transfer 2/3 c of the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip.

Split the cake horizontally into 3 layers and transfer one layer to a cake plate. Sprinkle the layer with 2 tsp of the remaining Kahlua, spread the top and sides with 1/3 of the remaining whipped cream, and top the layer with a second layer. Sprinkle the layer with Kahlua, spread it with whipped cream in the same manner, and repeat procedure with the remaining layer. Smooth the whipped cream on the top and sides with an offset knife. Pipe stars around the rim of the top.

Chill for at least 4 hours before serving.
