This can be made a day in advance. Once cool, wrap tightly with plastic and store at room temperature. 

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 stick (1/2 c) butter, melted and cooled to room temp, plus more for pan
* 1/2 c flour, plus more for the pan

</div>

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour the 9-inch pie plate or tart tin.

Whisk eggs, granulated sugar, almond extract, and salt in a large bowl until frothy and pale, about 30 seconds. Add 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c flour and stir until incorporated. Pour into the prepared pan. Top with sliced almonds and sprinkle with pearl or coarse sugar.

Bake until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20-25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool slightly before serving.
