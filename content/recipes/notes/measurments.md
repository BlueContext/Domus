### My Terrible Abbreviations
This blog contains recipes that I've typed into OneNote or Scrivener over the years, and I've changed my mind about abbreviating measurements several times. My apologies for the mess. One of these days I'll go through them all and clean it up.

In the meantime...

tsp = teaspoon
tbsp = tablespoon
c = cup 
lb = pound (a customary abbreviation)
oz = ounce
