This recipe is for use in savory dishes.  For a pastry suited for desserts, reduce salt to 1/4 tsp, add 1 tsp sugar, and omit the black pepper.  

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 1 cup water  
* 6 tbsp butter   
* 1 tsp salt  
* 1/8 tsp black pepper  
* Pinch of nutmeg  
* 1 cup flour  
* 4 large eggs

### Instructions

In a heavy-bottom saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt and seasonings to a boil.  Remove from heat and add the flour all at once. Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until completely blended. Return to medium high heat and keep stirring vigorously for at least two minutes, until the mixture pulls away from the sides and a film begins to form on the bottom. Don’t skip this step — you’re cooking water out of the paste, which will allow it to absorb more eggs and create larger puffs.

Remove saucepan from heat and make a well in the center.  Crack in one egg and beat into the paste for several seconds, until it’s completely absorbed.  Repeat this one egg at a time.  The last two eggs with take longer.

Note: the preceding step is much easier if you immediately transfer the dough to a standing mixer and use that to mix in the eggs.
