### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup semolina “00” flour
* 1 tbsp kosher salt 
* 4 large eggs  

</div>

### Instructions

In the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, add both flours and the salt and pulse 5-6 times to combine.

With the machine running, add 1 egg at a time through the feed tube. Once a ball of dough forms, allow the machine to run 30 more seconds to knead.

Divide the dough into 4 equal balls. Keep wrapped in plastic wrap unless working with the dough.
