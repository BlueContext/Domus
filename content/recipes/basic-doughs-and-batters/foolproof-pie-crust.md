title: Foolproof Pie Crust
serves: "Makes double-crusts for two pies"
summary: "I find that most pie crusts end up producing too little dough to complete a pie with a full top crust (or to do so without a lot of pinching and patching).  Since pie dough freezes beautifully and is great to have on hand, I’d rather make more than I need to save the remainder. Pies are tricky enough without making thing difficult for yourself.  The chilling of the fats and the water are crucial here, as is the chilling of the dough after you make it. This recipe produces a rather soft dough, but it gives me a beautiful finished pie every time."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

* 5 c flour
* 3 tsp kosher salt
* 12 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed and chilled in the freezer for 15 minutes
* 1 ½ c shortening, cubed and chilled in the freezer for 15 minutes
* A bowl or measuring cup with ice and at least ½ cup of water and ½ cup of vodka

### Instructions

Put the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor, and process for ten seconds to blend.

Add half of the butter and half of the shortening, and pulse until the consistency of cornmeal. Add the reset of the butter and shortening, and ½ cup of water mixture from the ice water bowl. Pulse until the fat is the size of large peas and the dough starts to form. Add another ½ cup of cold water mixture and pulse a few more times.

Turn the mixture out onto a board or large bowl and knead lightly until all the flour is incorporated. Divide the mass into three (for three generous crusts) or four (for four smaller crusts with fewer scraps) equal parts. Pat each part into a disk about 1” thick, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour before using. Pastry dough also freezes very well – after wrapping in plastic, wrap tightly in foil and freeze.
