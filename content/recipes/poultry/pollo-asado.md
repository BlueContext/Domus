Here in San Antonio, I can normally find Goya-brand achiote paste at H-E-B, but if you can’t find it at the store it can be ordered online. 

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">
  
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs  
Salt  
30 g (2 tbsp) Achiote paste  
1 habanero (or Fresno, or Serrano)   
2 garlic cloves  
1/2 red onion  
Juice from 1/2 orange  
Juice from 1/2 lime  
Peanut oil for the pan  

</div>

### Instructions
Place the achiote paste, habanero, garlic, red onion, orange juice, and lime juice into a blender with a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth.  Set aside 1/4 of the mixture. 

Lay your chicken on a sheet tray or in a bowl and sprinkle with salt so that each piece is seasoned. Pour the marinade over the chicken and mix until all pieces are completely coated. Marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.

When you’re ready to cook, oil a very hot cast iron pan or griddle. Sear the chicken until cooked through and nicely charred on all sides.

Let the chicken rest for a few minutes after cooking, and then chop it into bite-sized cubes and spoon over a bit of the reserved marinade for additional flavor and moisture.
