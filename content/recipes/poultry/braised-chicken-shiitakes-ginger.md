Oyster sauce is an odd ingredient that can add a striking depth of savory flavor. You can find it at most grocery stores these days, but an Asian grocer will definitely have it.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">
  
2 lbs chicken thighs  
2 tbsp oil  
12 shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and halved  
1 med yellow onion, thinly sliced  
1 cup chicken stock  
6 tbsp oyster sauce  
1/4 cup soy sauce  
3‚Äù piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced  
1 tsp cornstarch  
Sliced scallions to serve  
Toasted sesame seeds to serve

### Instructions
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high, heat the oil until barely smoking. Add the chicken skin down, reduce to medium and cook without disturbing until the skin is well browned, about 10 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the second sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large plate, then pour off and discard all but 3 tablespoons of fat from the pot. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken thighs.

Return the pot to medium and add the mushrooms and onion. Cover and cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to brown and the onion has softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the broth and 1 cup water, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the oyster sauce, soy sauce and ginger, then bring to a simmer. Return the chicken and accumulated juices to the pot, cover and cook over medium until a skewer inserted into the largest thigh meets no resistance, about 40 minutes, flipping the pieces halfway through.

Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a serving dish and cover to keep warm. In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons water and the cornstarch, then whisk the mixture into the cooking liquid. Bring to a simmer over medium-high and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper, then spoon the mushrooms and sauce over the chicken. 

Sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds.
