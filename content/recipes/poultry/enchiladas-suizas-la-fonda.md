### Instructions
#### Prepare the sauce
Place the oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion, serrano chile, garlic, and pepitas. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 3-5 minutes. Add the tomatillos and cook for an additional 10 minutes or until very soft. Add the crema Mexicana and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer and remove from heat. Allow it to cool for a few minutes.

Place the mixture in a blender (in batches) and puree to a smooth consistency. Taste and correct seasoning if needed.

#### Assemble the enchiladas
Prepare the garnish salad (see below), but don’t yet mix the salad with the vinaigrette.

Mix a couple spoonfuls of the sauce with the drained shredded chicken, which should be warm. Taste and correct seasoning if needed.

Spread a few spoonfuls of the sauce over the bottom of a baking dish large enough to snugly hold 12 enchiladas, such as a 9-by-13 baking dish.

Preheat oven to 350° F. Pour oil to a depth of 1/2” in a small skillet over medium high heat, and warm to a low frying temperature. Pass each tortilla quickly through the hot oil, just to soften. Drain on paper towels.

Fill the lower third of a softened tortilla with 2 tablespoons of the chicken filling. Roll it up and place it, seam-down, in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.

Generously cover the enchiladas with the sauce, making sure the edges of the tortillas are covered. Sprinkle the cheese over the top. Place under the broiler for about 5 minutes, or until the enchiladas are heated through and the cheese is melted and brown in spots.

Cover loosely with foil and let rest a few minutes.

When it’s time to serve, toss the salad with the dressing. There are two ways to use this garnish. If you’re going to bring the entire casserole to the table, sprinkle the salad lengthwise down the middle.  If you’re going to plate individual servings, place a large pinch of the salad on top or directly the side.

#### For the garnish (romaine salad)
Toss the lettuce, tomatoes, serrano, scallions and cilantro together. Whisk the lime juice, oil, salt and pepper to make a small vinaigrette. Just before serving, toss the salad with the dressing.
