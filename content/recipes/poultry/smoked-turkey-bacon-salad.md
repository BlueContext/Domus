Serve this at or near room temperature -- cooked bacon is not at its best when icebox-cold.  

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

8 slices thick-cut bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled  
4 cups cubed smoked turkey  
1 1/2 cups chopped celery  
1/2 cup sweet pickle relish  
1/2 to 1 cup good quality mayonnaise  
Salt and pepper to taste  

</div>

### Instructions
In a large bowl, gently toss together the bacon, turkey and celery. Fold in the relish and just enough mayonnaise to lightly coat everything.
