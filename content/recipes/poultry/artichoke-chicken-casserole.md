### Instructions
Preheat oven to 325°F.  Season chicken pieces all over with salt, pepper and paprika. 

Add 4 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil to a large heavy casserole or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the foam subsides, brown the chicken pieces very well all over (working in batches as necessary to avoid crowding the pan). Remove the chicken pieces to a plate, cover loosely with foil.

Briefly sauté the artichokes in the fat remaining in the pan. Remove them with a slotted spoon and reserve for the moment. Drain off all but a tbsp of the fat in the pan.

Add the last 2 tbsp butter to the fat remaining in the pan. Sauté the shallots and mushrooms until tender. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and cook, stirring, to remove the raw flour taste. Quickly add the cognac and deglaze the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. As the cognac boils, it may catch fire — that’s just the alcohol burning off. The flames aren’t required, but are harmless. Keep stirring and they’ll quickly subside.

Add the chicken stock, wine, sherry, and the dried herbs. Bring to simmer, stirring constantly, until everything is incorporated into smooth, slightly thick sauce. Taste and correct for seasoning with salt and pepper.

Return the chicken to the pot, turning the pieces in the sauce. Fold in the artichokes. Cover and bake for 45 minutes, until the chicken is very tender.

To serve, place the chicken pieces on a warm platter and pour the sauce and artichoke hearts over them. Sprinkle with minced parsley and serve at once.
