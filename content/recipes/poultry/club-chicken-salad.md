Serve this at or near room temperature -- neither bacon nor cheese are their best when cold.  This isn't really a make-ahead dish in any case - it holds for a while, but the avocado will eventually start to discolor unless you wait to cut it and mix it in at the last minute.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

4 tbsp white wine vinegar
1 scant tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp sugar
1 scant tsp salt
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
Breasts from a grocery store rotisserie chicken (cooled), cut into 3/4” cubes
6 slices thick-cut bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled
1 cup of Jarlsberg or Swiss cheese, cut into 1/2” cubes
1 avocado, cut into 3/4” cubes (optional)
1 red bell pepper, diced
6 scallions, sliced (white and green parts)
2 ribs celery, diced
1/2 can water chestnuts, rinsed and diced
1 jalapeño, minced
1/4 cup sliced Peppadew peppers
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
2/3 cups good quality mayonnaise (Duke’s is excellent)

### Instructions

In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste — you’ll want this salad highly seasoned, but remember that the bacon and cheese already bring a good amount of salt.  Whisking continuously, drizzle in the olive oil to make a lightly thickened vinaigrette. 

Add the chicken meat, bacon, swiss cheese, avocado (if using), bell pepper, scallions, celery, water chestnuts, jalapeño, pickled peppers, and cherry tomatoes.  Using a big spoon, fold everything to coat well with the vinaigrette, and then fold in the mayonnaise. Taste and correct the seasoning as necessary.
