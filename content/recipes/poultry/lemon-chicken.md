### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">
  
*For the chicken:*  
2 chicken breasts (boneless and skinless)  
1 egg, lightly beaten  
4 tbsp cornstarch  
Peanut oil for deep frying  
  
*For the sauce:*  
3 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
1/2 tsp ground turmeric  
1 tbsp sugar  
1 tbsp plum sauce   
A small pinch of white pepper  
6 oz water  
1 tbsp cornstarch   

</div>

### Instructions
Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 2 thin scallops. Dip them in the beaten egg and coat with cornstarch. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a wok or large pan and deep-fry the chicken until golden brown. Keep warm.

Mix together all the sauce ingredients, stirring well to avoid lumps. Bring the sauce to slow simmer in a small pan, stirring continually. Add a bit of water if it’s too thick. It should be about the consistency of half-and-half. Season to taste with salt.

Slice the chicken into 1-inch strips and place on a serving plate. Pour the sauce over and serve garnished with lemon wedges.
