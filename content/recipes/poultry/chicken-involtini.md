title: Chicken Involtini with Prosciutto, Provolone & Sage
serves: "Serves 4"
summary: "This is a very pretty dish that looks much more complicated than it is. I developed this recipe, but it's based on a traditional Italian dish and can easily be adapted to various ingredients and tastes. If it's payday, try this with veal scallops instead of chicken."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

4 boneless skinless chicken breasts  
4 thin slices prosciutto  
4 slices provolone cheese  
1 roasted red bell pepper, cut into strips  
4 whole sage leaves + 2 minced sage leaves  
2 tbsp. olive oil  
4 tbsp. + 2 tbsp. Butter  
1 tablespoon cognac  
½ cup white vermouth or white wine  
½ cup chicken broth  
2 chopped shallots (or half of 1 white onion, minced)  
Lemon juice to taste  
1-2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley

### Instructions
Place each chicken breast between two sheets of waxed paper (or in a gallon-sized plastic freezer bag) and use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to pound the breast flat. Be careful to pound it out to an even thickness without breaking holes in the meat.

Lay each chicken breast on a work surface and season with salt and pepper. Lay a slice of prosciutto and a slice of provolone over the chicken and place a sage leaf and a strip of roasted red pepper in the center. Carefully roll the chicken into a tight packet and secure it with wooden toothpicks. Season the rolled breasts with salt and pepper.

Place a heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil and 4 tbsp. butter. When the butter foam subsides, add the chicken packets and cook, turning frequently, until attractively browned on all sides. If the internal temperature is not at least 160F, cover the pan and cook a bit longer.

Remove the chicken, cover loosely with foil, and set aside to rest. Discard the fat in the pan and return it to the heat. Add 2 tbsp. butter. When the foam subsides, add the shallots and the minced sage leaves, and cook, stirring, until soft and translucent. Add the cognac and begin to deglaze the pan (this will likely catch fire, so be careful and just shake the pan until the flames die down). Add the vermouth or wine and chicken broth. Stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to release browned bits. Continue cooking until the sauce is reduced and glossy. 

Season to taste with salt, black pepper, drops of lemon juice and dashes of Tabasco. Add the parsley.

To serve, remove the wooden picks from the chicken breasts and either slice each packet in 4 slices or cut each one diagonally.  Arrange the chicken on dinner plates and pour sauce over each serving.
