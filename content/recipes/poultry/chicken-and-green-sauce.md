### Instructions
In a small bowl, combine the garlic, cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper, oregano, olive oil, vinegar, and the zest and juice of the lemon. 

Stir to combine. Scatter the sliced onions over the bottom of a dish large enough to hold the flattened out chicken (I use a rimmed baking sheet).

Dry the chicken thoroughly and place it on the onion slices, breast-side up. Use your fingers to gently spread the spice mixture under the skin of the thighs and breast, on the outside all over the chicken, and on the cavity side. Season with a bit more salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for between 4 and 24 hours. 

When you’re ready to roast, remove the chicken from the fridge and allow it to come back to room temperature. Preheat your oven to 425 F. Roast the chicken for 15 minutes at 425.  Baste with any juice in the roasting pan, rotate the bird, and reduce heat to 375 F. Roast for 30-45 more minutes, basting occasionally, until the juices run clear and the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 F on an instant thermometer. 

While the chicken is roasting, make the green sauce. In the jar of a blender, combine the jalapenos, cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, lime juice, vinegar and olive oil. Blend on high speed, scraping down as necessary, until smooth. Season to taste and transfer to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to eat.

Serve the chicken with the chilled green sauce along with rice and beans.
