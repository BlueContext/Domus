### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">
  
* 1 recipe [Chicken with White Wine & Herbs]({{< ref "/recipes/poultry/chicken-white-wine-herbs.md" >}} "Chicken with White Wine & Herbs") 
* 1 18 oz. package all-butter puff pastry, thawed in the refrigerator
* 2 thick slices good-quality ham steak, cut into strips
* 1 heaping tbsp finely chopped fresh tarragon
* 1 egg, beaten

</div>

### Instructions
Roll out the pastry on a floured surface and, using your pie dish as a template, cut out a piece to generously fit the top. From the trimmings, cut a 3/4" strip to fit around the rim of the dish. Wet the edges of the dish and stick the strip in place around the edge. 

Mix the ham and tarragon into the chicken filling, then spoon this into the dish. Dampen the top of the pastry strip and place the pastry round on top. Trim the edges and press down gently. Decorate the top with cuttings from the pastry scraps if you like. Brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg. Make a small slit in the top to allow steam to escape. 

At this point the pie can baked, refrigerated for up to 4 hours or frozen.

Preheat the oven to 375F. If the pie has been refrigerated, let it sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking. Bake the pie for 30-35 minutes, or until it is piping hot and the pastry is deeply golden.
