title: Chicken & Dumplings
serves: "Serves 6-8"
summary: "This is my adaptation of an old recipe from Gourmet Magazine, and it’s the best version of chicken and dumplings that I know. The stew is rich and flavorful, and the dumplings are light and fluffy with a slight bite from the addition of cornmeal. It’s just perfect. "

Don’t skip the apple cider — it’s an odd ingredient, and you won’t taste it in the final dish, but it definitely adds something.  

You can use the pieces of a single whole chicken, but I prefer a mix of thighs and legs. Dark meat is superior for long-simmered chicken dishes.  

I often halve this recipe — it will still serve 4 generously. 

This hearty dish only needs a salad or some cheese and bread along with a bottle of cold white wine to make a magnificent dinner.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

4 pounds chicken parts (thighs only, or a mix of legs and thighs)  
1 cup all-purpose flour, seasoned with salt and pepper  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
1 tablespoon olive oil

### Instructions

Season the chicken parts with salt and pepper. Dredge them in seasoned flour, shaking off excess, and put on a rack. Allow to set for at least 10 minutes.

In a large dutch oven melt butter with oil over moderately high heat until foam subsides and brown chicken in batches (do not crowd), transferring it to a plate as done, about 5 minutes on each side. 

Stir in leeks and shallots with a pinch of salt, and cook 3 minutes, scraping the bottom and stirring occasionally. Stir in carrots, parsnips, celery, bay leaf, and thyme, black pepper to taste, and cook 3 minutes. Stir in broth, cider, and chicken and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered partially, until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Taste for salt and correct seasoning as needed. Reduce heat to low. 

Remove the chicken parts to a large plate and allow to cool until they can be easily handled. Pull off the skin and discard. Pull the meat off the bones, tearing into bite-sized chunks, and return it to the pot. Return dheat to medium and bring back to a simmer. 

Into a bowl sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt and stir in dill. With a fork stir in half-and-half until dough is just blended. 

Stir the frozen peas and parsley (and optional cream) into the chicken mixture. Taste the mixture and correct seasoning. Discard the bay leaf. 

With a large soup spoon scoop out 12 dumplings and arrange over chicken mixture. Simmer chicken and dumplings, covered, for 12-15 minutes. (Dumplings are done when a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.)  

Serve when ready. Although the chicken stew will hold beautifully and is delicious leftover, the dumplings will not hold up as well.
