summary: "In the 50s and 60s there was an entire genre of recipes involving cooking with your broiler. In an earlier age, this was generally what was meant by 'grilled'. I love charcoal grilling, but I hope this recipe will convince you to reclaim the broiler as a primary cooking method."

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">
  
1 fryer chicken (around 4.5 lbs), whole, spatchcocked  
6 tbsp butter  
2 tbsp oil   
6 tbsp Dijon mustard  
3 tbsp finely minced shallots or scallions  
1/2 tsp thyme, basil or tarragon  
1/4 tsp black pepper  
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 
Tabasco sauce to taste  
3 cups panko breadcrumbs  

</div>

### Instructions
Preheat the oven broiler. Melt the butter with the oil in a small saucepan.  Have a brush handy.

Dry the chicken thoroughly and brush it all over with the butter-oil mixture. Place skin-side down on a rimmed baking sheet. Place under the broiler so that the chicken is 5-6 inches from the heating element and broil 10 minutes on each side, basting every five minutes. The chicken should be lightly browned. Salt it lightly.

Blend the mustard with the shallots, herbs and seasonings in a bowl. Drop by drop, beat in half of the basting fat to make an emulsion.  Reserve the rest of the basting fat for later.  Paint the chicken with the mustard mixture.

Spread the crumbs on a large plate or small rimmed baking sheet. Dredge the chicken in the crumbs, patting them to adhere. 

Carefully place the chicken skin-side down on a rack placed over a rimmed baking sheet.  Drizzle half the remaining fat over the surface. Broil slowly for 10 minutes.  Turn the chicken skin-side up, baste with the last of the fat, and broil for another 10 minutes.

Transfer to a cutting board, cut into serving pieces, and serve.
