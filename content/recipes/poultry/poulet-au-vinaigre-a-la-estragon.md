### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

2 cups frozen pearl onions, thawed  
2 tbsp olive oil  
1 tbsp unsalted butter   
3 1/2 lbs chicken pieces  
1 cup tarragon white-wine vinegar (or plain white wine vinegar)  
1/2 cup dry white vermouth or wine  
1 1/2 cups chicken stock  
1 cup chopped canned tomatoes, drained  
1/2 tsp dried tarragon (IF you are not using tarragon vinegar)

### Instructions

Pat the chicken dry and season it with salt and pepper on all sides.

In a heavy casserole over medium high heat, heat the oil and butter until the foam subsides. Brown the chicken pieces well on both sides. Work in batches, transferring the chicken to a plate when it is done.

Pour excess fat from the pan, add the pearl onions, and sautee, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and the wine, and bring the mixture the boil, scraping the bottom of the pan to be sure that all brown bits are dissolved. Add the broth, the tomatoes, and the dried tarragon if you are using it. 

Return the chicken to the casserole and bring everything to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20-25 minutes.

Transfer the chicken and as many of the onions are you can catch to a warmed serving platter. 

Stir the arrowroot or cornstarch mixture into the simmering cooking liquid. Stir in half of the chopped fresh tarragon, and simmer the sauce for 1 minute. Spoon the thickened sauce over the chicken and onions, sprinkle with the remaining chopped fresh tarragon, and garnish with sprigs of fresh tarragon if desired.
