### Instructions
Place the leg quarters, bay leaves, tarragon, peppercorns, parsley stalks, white wine, and 1 celery stalk in a large pot. Halve one of the onions and one of the carrots and add them to the pot. Add enough cold water to cover everything, about 1 quart. Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer and cook, half-covered, for 25 minutes or until the juices in the legs run clear.

Remove chicken leg quarters from the pot and set aside.  Keep the stock simmering.  Meanwhile, chop the remaining onions, carrots and celery into small chunks.

In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter and sweat the chopped vegetables with a pinch of salt for 6 to 8 minutes. While that cooks, strip the chicken meat off the bones and set aside. Add the bones and skin back into the stock pot and continue simmering.

Add the mushrooms and garlic to the pan with the chopped vegetables and increase the heat to brown the vegetables lightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook gently for 1 minute. Strain the stock into a measuring cup and measure out 2 cups (you can freeze any extra). Add nearly all the stock and a very small dash of soy sauce to the pan, stirring it in slowly until to comes back to a simmer and thickens. Add a little more stock to thin to the desired consistency if needed. It should just coat the back of a spoon. Chop the parsley leaves and add to the pan along with the chicken meat. Stir in the cream, simmer until everything is hot and well-combined, and adjust seasoning to taste.
