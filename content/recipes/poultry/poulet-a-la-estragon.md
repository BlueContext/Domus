You don't need more than a simple green vegetable, a crispy baguette and a cold bottle of dry white wine to make a splendid meal of this.
### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 chicken, cut into pieces, skin removed  
1/2 c flour  
2 tbsp olive oil  
4 tbsp butter  
3 shallots, finely minced  
1/2 c frozen pearl onions  
1/4 c Cognac  
1/4 c dry Vermouth   
1/2 c dry white wine  
3 large sprigs + 1 tbsp. chopped fresh tarragon  
1/4 tsp dried marjoram  
1 tsp minced fresh chervil or parsley  
3/4 c heavy cream  

</div>

### Instructions
Season the flour with salt and pepper, and flour the chicken pieces completely but very lightly, shaking off the excess.

Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat, and add the oil and 4 tbsp. butter. When foam subsides, add the floured chicken to the pan and brown the pieces over medium to medium-high heat. Transfer the chicken pieces to a plate as they finish browning.

When the chicken has all been removed, discard the fat in the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining butter. When it foams and begins to subside, add the pearl onions and sauté until glazed and slightly browned.  Add the shallots and sauté until soft and translucent. 

Increase the heat, add the Cognac and flambee, stirring and scraping vigorously, until the flames subside. Add the vermouth, white wine, whole sprigs of tarragon and dried marjoram. Bring to a boil, scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan.

Return the chicken pieces to the pan, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken and simmer 20 minutes more (chicken should be just done).

Remove the chicken to a bowl or platter and cover to keep warm. Increase heat to medium-high and add the cream to the pan. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the cream thickens and the sauce coats a spoon. Add ½ tbsp. minced tarragon and ½ tbsp. minced chervil.  Correct seasoning to taste.

Return any juices from the chicken to the sauce, and turn the chicken pieces in the sauce to coat. Transfer chicken to a serving platter or bowl and nap lightly with the sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining minced herbs and serve with the remaining sauce in in a bowl.
