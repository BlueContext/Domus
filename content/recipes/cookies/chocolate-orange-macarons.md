title: Chocolate Orange Macarons
serves: "Makes about 3 dozen"
summary: "These definitely require some practice to get right, but you’ll be so proud to serve these rich, dark, pretty little French cookies. People like to make macarons in every color of the rainbow, and they’re certainly pretty, but I think chocolate is the best flavor by far — that bitter edge saves the cookie from being insipidly sweet."

A few days before you make the cookies, get a good 6 cups of confectioner's sugar and a vanilla bean or two.  Split the vanilla bean(s) lengthwise, and pack them in an airtight container with the powdered sugar.  Over the next few days, the flavor and aroma from the vanilla beans will suffuse the sugar, giving you a fantastic vanilla sugar coat the finished cookies with.

### Instructions
#### To make the cookies:
Arrange racks in lower and upper thirds of the oven and preheat to 325 F. Line three rimless baking sheets with parchment paper. 

Pulse 1 cup of powdered sugar with the almonds in a food processor until the nuts are finely ground (but be careful to avoid forming a paste). Add the cocoa powder and remaining 1 cup of powdered sugar; process to blend well.  Sift the mixture through a medium-mesh strainer, discarding any large pieces of almond left behind (if more than 1 tbsp remains, pulse that in the food processor to grind it more finely).

In an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, beat 1/3 cup of egg whites on medium speed until white and frothy, about 1 minute. With the mixer on medium-low, add the sugar a spoonful at a time. Increase speed to medium high and beat until firm peaks form.  Stir in the remaining 3 tbsp of egg whites.

Fold the meringue into the dry ingredients in three additions, being careful to gently fold — not stir — the second and third additions. Mix just until everything is combined and no white streaks remain.

Spoon the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/4” tip.  Twist the top of the bag and pipe quarter-sized rounds onto 2 of the three prepared baking sheets, spacing 1” apart. Let them rest, uncovered, until the top of each cookie appears dry, about 10 minutes. This step is important for forming the characteristic shape of a French macaron, with a shiny domed top and  ruffled “foot” beneath.

Bake the cookies, rotating the position of the sheets about halfway through, until they are puffed and dry, around 16 minutes. Slide the parchment sheets with the cookies onto a wire rack and let them cool completely — they’ll be easy to peel off the paper once thoroughly cool.

Use the remaining batter with the third cookie sheet to make the rest of the cookies.

#### To make the Ganache Filling: 
Place the chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cream just to a boil. Remove from the heat, and stir in the orange zest, spices, and salt. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate and butter, and whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.

Sandwich flat sides of macaroons together with 1/2 teaspoon of filling. 

#### To Assemble:
Spoon the ganache into a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/4” tip. Pipe  about 1 tsp of ganache onto the flat side of a cookie, leaving 1/4 - 1/8” around the edge. Top with a second cookie, flat side down. Repeat with the remaining cookies.

If you like, brush or sprinkle a bit of edible gold dust onto the top of each cookie, or top with a fleck of gold leaf. This is quite literally gilding the lily, but it makes for a very special addition to a tray of Christmas cookies.
