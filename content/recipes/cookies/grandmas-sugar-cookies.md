title: Grandma’s Sugar Cookies
serves: "Makes about 40"
summary: "This recipe comes to me from my grandmother via my aunt. It produces a cakey, tender cookie with a lovely lemon scent. The shortening is critical to the proper texture of the cookie — you could replace some, but not all, with butter for flavor."

Preheat oven to 375 F.

In a large bowl, combine the shortening, salt, lemon zest and nutmeg. Add the sugar and beat until fluffy and light. Beat in the eggs and milk and mix until well combined. Sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda together and add to the shortening mixture. Mix until just completely combined.
