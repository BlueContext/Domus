### Ingredients

* granulated sugar for rolling

### Instructions
Sift the flour, sugar and salt into the bowl of your mixer. Add the butter, egg yolks and vanilla; mix at a low speed until the dough is thoroughly blended. It may be very crumbly. Take to bowl off the mixer and work the dough with your hands until it starts to form a single mass. If it remains too crumbly, sprinkle a tablespoon of water over the dough and work it in thoroughly.   

Scrape the dough out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, wrap tightly and chill for 1-2 hours.

Preheat your oven to 350F. Lightly beat the egg whites and set aside. Pour granulated sugar onto a small plate. Cover one or two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Divide the dough into portions the size of a small walnut. Roll each ball between the palms of your hands to give it the shape of a sewing machine shuttle (an oval pointed on the ends) – they should be about 2 ½” long and ½” thick.  Dip each cookie in the egg whites and roll in granulated sugar.

Bake the cookies on the parchment-covered baking sheet for about 8 minutes or until lightly browned.
