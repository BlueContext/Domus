### Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 F and line 2 heavy baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, melt the unsweetened chocolate, 1 c of the chocolate chips, and the butter, stirring until smooth. Remove the bowl from the hot water and set aside.

In the bowl of your mixer, beat the eggs, sugar, and ground coffee on high speed until the mixture is very thick and pale and forms ribbons when the beater is lifted, about 3 minutes. Beat in the chocolate mixture at medium speed. With the mixture running on low, sift in the flour, baking powder and salt until just combined. Mix in the remaining chocolate chips and walnuts.

Drop batter by heaping tablespoons about 2‚Äù apart onto baking sheets and bake in batches in the middle of the oven, 8 to 10 minutes, or until puffed and cracked on top. Cool cookies on baking sheets for 1 minute and transfer to rack to cool completely.
