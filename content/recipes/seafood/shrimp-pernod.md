<div class="ingredient-list">

30 large shrimp, shelled and deveined  
Flour for dredging  
6 tbsp butter  
6 tbsp olive oil  
3 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced

</div>

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 F. Season the flour with salt and black pepper. Mix the Pernod, wine or vermouth and Campari in a small prep bowl. 

Place the butter and oil in a large oven-proof skillet or saut√© pan over medium-high heat.  Dredge the shrimp in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.

Once the butter foam begins to subside, add the garlic and pepper flakes to the pan and cook, stirring briskly, for one minute. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Add the Pernod mixture to the pan, and move the pan to the oven. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, stir in the parsley, and serve.
