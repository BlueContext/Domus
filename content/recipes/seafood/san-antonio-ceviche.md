### Instructions
Blanch the shrimp and scallops in boiling water for 1 1/2 minutes. Drain well, and chop into small pieces. Place them in a glass bowl and add enough lime juice to cover.

Add the tomato, onion, jalapeño, cilantro, ketchup, and 5-6 dashes Tabasco sauce. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 2 days (it will taste best if it marinates at least overnight).

Use a slotted spoon to serve the ceviche on lettuce leaves. Garnish with avocado slices, and serve with tortilla chips.
