title: Spicy New Orleans BBQ Shrimp
serves: "Serves 4 as a starter, or 2 as a main course"
summary: "There are many delicious versions of this southern California specialty. I think you'll like this one. Grilled fish tacos are also great, but the classic fried fish taco is all about contrasting textures. It’s hard to beat the combination of textures and flavors in every bite."

### Ingredients
This looks like a lot, but just make the cremas, prep the garnishes and shred the cabbage in advance -- now you have nothing to do but fry some fish.

<div class="ingredient-list">

20 corn tortillas
Some vegetable oil and a brush
1 large egg
1/2 cup beer (any American lager is fine)
1/2 cup flour
2 tsp of the seasoning mix described below

4 cups finely shredded cabbage (green or red, or a mixture)

### Instructions
#### Seasoning Mixture
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl, and set aside.

#### Chipotle Crema
Place the crema, sour cream, and whole cream in a blender with the salt. Roughly chop the chipotles and add them (along with any adobo and juices) to the blender. Blend just until smooth.  Stir in the lime juice, and correct seasoning if necessary.  Remove to a small bowl and set aside.

#### Poblano Crema
Follow the instructions for Chipotle crema, replacing the chipotle with roasted poblanos or Hatch chiles that have been skinned, seeded, and roughly chopped.

#### The Tacos
Prepare the seasoning mixture and cremas (as above). Cover and refrigerate the cremas.

Brush tortillas lightly with oil, and warm each of them in a comal or dry cast-iron pan over medium heat, turning frequently until they are pliable, warm, and just beginning to toast on the edges. Place in a tortilla warmer or wrap in a kitchen towel, and set aside

In a large pot or deep fryer, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. over high heat. 

In a large bowl, beat the egg with the beer. Add the flour, seasoning, and baking powder, and whisk to make a thin batter. 

Dip the fish in the batter, turning to coat, and shake to remove any excess. Fry in batches in the oil until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels, and season lightly with a bit more of the seasoning mixture.

Stack 2 tortillas together on plates, and top with the fish. Squeeze with lime juice, and top the fish with cabbage, crema, and salsa to taste. Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.
