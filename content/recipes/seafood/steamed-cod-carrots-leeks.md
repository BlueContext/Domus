### Instructions
Combine the butter, half of the lemon zest, half of the garlic, the shallot, thyme, optional dried herbs, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp cracked black pepper in a small bowl. Cover and set aside.

In another small bowl, combine the parsley, remaining lemon zest and remaining garlic; cover and set aside. 

After throughly and repeatedly washing the leeks, dry the leeks and carrots thoroughly. Place them in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper, and toss.

Adjust oven rack to bottom position and heat the oven to 450 degrees.  Cut eight 12-inch squares of aluminum foil, and arrange four of them on the counter.  Divide the vegetable mixture among the four sheets, mounding it in the middle of each sheet. Pour 2 tablespoons of vermouth over each pile of vegetables. 

Carefully pat the cod fillets until dry. Season with salt and pepper, and place one fillet on each mound of vegetables.  Spread 1/4 of the compound butter evenly over the top of each fillet. Place another square of foil on top of the fish. Crimp the edges, folding over in a half-inch fold. Fold over three more times on each edge. The packets should be roughly 7” square and tightly sealed.  Place on a large rimmed baking sheet (they can overlap).

Bake the packets for 15 minutes. Very carefully cut into the foil and peel it back. Use a large spatula to carefully transfer the fish and vegetables to 4 plates. Pour any accumulated butter and juices over the fish. Sprinkle a bit of the parsley mixture over each serving, and serve immediately, passing lemon wedges separately.
