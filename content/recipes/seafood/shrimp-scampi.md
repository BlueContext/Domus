title: Shrimp Scampi
serves: "Serves 4 as a starter, or 2 as a main course"
summary: "The only real trick to this simple classic is to cook the shrimp just until the moment they're pink all over, but before they start to curl up. The delicious wine-garlic-butter sauce cries out for some crusty bread to mop it up."

Experience says this will serve 4-6 as an appetizer, and 2-4 as a main (depending on appetite, other dishes, etc.)

### Instructions
Toss the shrimp with the vermouth and set aside.

In a small bowl, mash together the butter, garlic, parsley, tarragon, lemon juice, red pepper, salt, plenty of black pepper and a dash of Tabasco until well incorporated.

Preheat oven to 425.

Arrange the shrimp side-by-side in a single layer in a ceramic baking dish. Discard accumulated juices. Sprinkle a few drops of vermouth over the shrimp, and spread a scant teaspoon of the seasoned butter over each shrimp.

Bake the shrimp for 7 minutes and remove from oven.

Turn on the broiler and move the rack so that the dish will be about 6" from the broiler.

Broil the shrimp for 2-3 minutes, just until browned and bubbling.

Serve immediately with lemon wedges and crusty bread.
