### Introduction

This is a recipe I clipped from some H-E-B circular years ago, which...may not sound promising, but it’s a winner. Grill the corn and roast the peppers over lump hardwood charcoal to add a delicious smoky dimension to this dish. It’s also great with scallops instead of shrimp.

### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1/2 lb jumbo Gulf shrimp, peeled and deveined  
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces  
12 ounces fresh Campanile or Radiatori cooked al dente (8 ounces dry)  
1/2 large yellow onion, diced  
3 ears corn, roasted on a grill or over a gas burner, and kernels cut off  
2 roasted red peppers, cut into 1/3-inch dice  
1 roasted poblano pepper, cut into 1/3-inch dice  
1 roasted jalapeño, diced small  
1 tbsp flour  
1 cup chicken broth  
1 cup heavy cream  
1 tbsp chopped cilantro  
Salt, pepper and Tabasco sauce to taste  
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Instructions

In a large skillet, fry bacon until crisp. Remove to drain on paper towels and set aside. Leave 1 tbsp bacon fat in the pan, discarding the remainder.

Over medium heat, sauté the shrimp, onion, corn, half of the roasted peppers, and jalapeño for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

Add the chicken broth, cream, chopped cilantro, and half of the bacon. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the drained pasta and the remaining peppers.

Season to taste and serve in pasta bowls.  Top with remaining bacon, cheese, and additional black pepper.
