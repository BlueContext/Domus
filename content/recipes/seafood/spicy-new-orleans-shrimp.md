### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

1 lbs large shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 tbsp butter 
2 tbsp olive oil 
2 tbsp sweet chili sauce 
1 tbsp Worcestershire 
1 tsp chili powder  
1 tsp smoked paprika 
1 tsp dried oregano 
1 tsp sriracha hot sauce or tabasco 
4 cloves garlic, minced 
Juice from 1/2 lemon 
Salt and pepper to taste 
2 tbsp chopped parsley 
Crusty French bread and lemon wedges for serving

</div>
Experience says this will serve 4-6 as an appetizer, and 2-4 as a main (depending on appetite, other dishes, etc.)

### Instructions
Add everything but the shrimp to oven-safe skillet, stir to combine, and let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes or so. 

Add the shrimp and toss it around so that itâ€™s fully immersed in the sauce. Transfer to a non-reactive bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (but no more than 2 hours or so). Clean and dry the cast iron pan.

Place the pan in the oven and preheat to 400 F. Carefully remove the hot pan and add the shrimp. Return the pan to the oven, and broil for 5-10 minutes (watching carefully!) until the shrimp are just done and the mixture is bubbly.

Serve immediately with crusty French bread and drizzle with additional lemon juice as needed.
