### Ingredients

<div class="ingredient-list">

7 tbsp flour  
7 tbsp cornstarch  
1 tsp baking powder

### Instructions
Reserve 2 tablespoons of flour on a plate.  Place the remaining flour, the cornstarch, baking powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk to combine.

While whisking with a fork, add the beer and water. Continue stirring to form a thick, smooth batter.  Cover and refrigerate to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Place the fish fillets on a paper towel and carefully pat them dry. Season with salt and pepper.

Heat the oil to 350 in a Dutch oven.

Dust each fillet in the reserved flour, shaking off any excess.  Dip the fillets in the batter, being careful to coat them completely.  Drop them carefully into the hot oil. Fry for roughly 8 minutes, turning every minute or so with a slotted spoon, until golden brown.

Remove the fish from the oil and drain on paper. Season with sea salt while hot.
